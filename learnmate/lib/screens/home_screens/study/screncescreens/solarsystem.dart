From the surface of Mercury, the Sun would appear more than three times as large as it does when viewed from Earth, and the sunlight would be as much as seven times brighter. Despite its proximity to the Sun, Mercury is not the hottest planet in our solar system</span><span> &ndash; </span><span>that title belongs to nearby Venus, thanks to its dense atmosphere. But Mercury is the fastest planet, zipping around the Sun every 88 Earth days.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Mercury is appropriately named for the swiftest of the ancient Roman gods.</span></span></p><h3><span><b>Size and Distance</b></span></h3>  <p>With a radius of 1,516 miles (2,440 kilometers), Mercury is a little more than 1/3 the width of Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Mercury would be about as big as a blueberry.</p>  <p>From an average distance of 36 million miles (58 million kilometers), Mercury is 0.4 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 3.2 minutes to travel from the Sun to Mercury.</p><h3><span><b>Orbit and Rotation</b></span></h3>  <p>Mercury&#39;s highly eccentric, egg-shaped orbit takes the planet as close as 29 million miles (47 million kilometers) and as far as 43 million miles (70 million kilometers) from the Sun. It speeds around the Sun every 88 days, traveling through space at nearly 29 miles (47 kilometers) per second, faster than any other planet.</p>  <p>Mercury spins slowly on its axis and completes one rotation every 59 Earth days. But when Mercury is moving fastest in its elliptical orbit around the Sun (and it is closest to the Sun), each rotation is not accompanied by a sunrise and sunset like it is on most other planets. The morning Sun appears to rise briefly, set and rise again from some parts of the planet&#39;s surface. The same thing happens in reverse at sunset for other parts of the surface. One Mercury solar day (one full day-night cycle) equals 176 Earth days&mdash;just over two years on Mercury.  </p>  <p>Mercury&#39;s axis of rotation is tilted just 2 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun. That means it spins nearly perfectly upright and so does not experience seasons like many other planets do. </p><h3><b>Structure</b></h3>  <p>Mercury is the second densest planet, after Earth. It has a large metallic core with a radius of about 1,289 miles (2,074 kilometers), about 85 percent of the planet&#39;s radius. There is evidence that it is partly molten, or liquid. Mercury&#39;s outer shell, comparable to Earth&#39;s outer shell (called the mantle and crust), is only about 400 kilometers (250 miles) thick.</p><h3><span><b>Formation</b></span></h3>  <p>Mercury formed about 4.5 billion years ago when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust together to form this small planet nearest the Sun. Like its fellow terrestrial planets, Mercury has a central core, a rocky mantle and a solid crust.</p><h2 class='title'> Kid-Friendly Mercury </h2> <div class='description'> <p>Mercury is the smallest planet in our solar system. It&rsquo;s a little bigger than Earth&rsquo;s Moon. It is the closest planet to the Sun, but it&rsquo;s actually not the hottest. Venus is hotter.</p>  <p>Along with Venus, Earth, and Mars, Mercury is one of the rocky planets. It has a solid surface that is covered with craters like our Moon. It has a thin atmosphere, and it doesn&rsquo;t have any moons. Mercury likes to keep things simple.</p>  <p>Mercury spins slowly compared to Earth, so one day lasts a long time. Mercury takes 59 Earth days to make one full rotation. But a year on Mercury goes fast. Because it&rsquo;s the closest planet to the sun, it goes around the Sun in just 88 Earth days.</p><h3><span><b>Surface</b></span></h3>  <p>Mercury&#39;s surface resembles that of Earth&#39;s moon, scarred by many impact craters resulting from collisions with meteoroids and comets. Craters and features on Mercury are named after famous deceased artists, musicians or authors, including children&#39;s author Dr. Seuss and dance pioneer Alvin Ailey.</p>  <p>Very large impact basins, including Caloris (960 miles or 1,550 kilometers in diameter) and Rachmaninoff (190 miles, or 306 kilometers in diameter), were created by asteroid impacts on the planet&#39;s surface early in the solar system&#39;s history. While there are large areas of smooth terrain, there are also cliffs, some hundreds of miles long and soaring up to a mile high. They rose as the planet&#39;s interior cooled and contracted over the billions of years since Mercury formed.</p>  <p>Most of Mercury&#39;s surface would appear greyish-brown to the human eye. The bright streaks are called &quot;crater rays.&quot; They are formed when an asteroid or comet strikes the surface. The tremendous amount of energy that is released in such an impact digs a big hole in the ground, and also crushes a huge amount of rock under the point of impact. Some of this crushed material is thrown far from the crater and then falls to the surface, forming the rays. Fine particles of crushed rock are more reflective than large pieces, so the rays look brighter. The space environment&mdash;dust impacts and solar-wind particles&mdash;causes the rays to darken with time.</p>  <p>Temperatures on the surface of Mercury are extreme, both hot and cold. During the day, temperatures on Mercury&#39;s surface can reach 800 degrees Fahrenheit (430 degrees Celsius). Because the planet has no atmosphere to retain that heat, nighttime temperatures on the surface can drop to minus 290 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 180 degrees Celsius).</p>  <p>Mercury may have water ice at its north and south poles inside deep craters, but only in regions of permanent shadow. There it could be cold enough to preserve water ice despite the high temperatures on sunlit parts of the planet.</p><h3><span><b>Atmosphere</b></span></h3>  <p>Instead of an atmosphere, Mercury possesses a thin exosphere made up of atoms blasted off the surface by the solar wind and striking meteoroids. Mercury&#39;s exosphere is composed mostly of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium and potassium. <span><span> </span></span></p>  <p><span class="mb_anchor_title" style="cursor:default; outline:yellow solid 2px">Magnetosphere<a class="mb_anchor" name="magnetosphere"></a></span></p>  <h3><b>Magnetosphere</b></h3>  <p>Mercury&#39;s magnetic field is offset relative to the planet&#39;s equator. Though Mercury&#39;s magnetic field at the surface has just one percent the strength of Earth&#39;s, it interacts with the magnetic field of the solar wind to sometimes create intense magnetic tornadoes that funnel the fast, hot solar wind plasma down to the surface of the planet. When the ions strike the surface, they knock off neutrally charged atoms and send them on a loop high into the sky.</p>  <p><span class="mb_anchor_title" style="cursor:default; outline:yellow solid 2px">Moons<a class="mb_anchor" name="moons"></a></span></p>  <h3><b>Moons</b></h3>  <p>Mercury has no moon.</p>  <p><span><span><span class="mb_anchor_title">Potential for Life<a class="mb_anchor" name="potential_for_life"></a></span></span></span></p>  <h3><span><b>Potential for Life</b></span></h3>  <p>Mercury&#39;s environment is not conducive to life as we know it.

    """<p>Venus is the second planet from the Sun and our closest planetary neighbor. Similar in structure and size to Earth, Venus spins slowly in the opposite direction from most planets.

Venus is one of just two planets that rotate from east to west. Only Venus and Uranus have this &quot;backwards&quot; rotation. It completes one rotation in 243 Earth days &mdash; the longest day of any planet in our solar system, even longer than a whole year on Venus. But the Sun doesn&#39;t rise and set each &quot;day&quot; on Venus like it does on most other planets. On Venus, one day-night cycle takes 117 Earth days because Venus rotates in the direction opposite of its orbital revolution around the Sun. <span><span> </span></span></p>  <p>Venus makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Venusian time) in 225 Earth days or slightly less than two Venusian day-night cycles. Its orbit around the Sun is the most circular of any planet &mdash; nearly a perfect circle. Other planet&#39;s orbits are more elliptical, or oval-shaped.</p>  <p>With an axial tilt of just 3 degrees, Venus spins nearly upright, and so does not experience noticeable seasons.</p>  <p><span class="mb_anchor_title">Structure<a class="mb_anchor" name="structure"></a></span></p>  <h3>Structure</h3>  <p>Venus is in many ways similar to Earth in its structure. It has an iron core that is approximately 2,000 miles (3,200 kilometers) in radius. Above that is a mantle made of hot rock slowly churning due to the planet&#39;s interior heat.

At the surface, the rocks are different shades of grey, like rocks on Earth, but the thick atmosphere filters the sunlight so that everything would look orange if you were standing on Venus.</p>  <p>Venus has mountains, valleys, and tens of thousands of volcanoes. The highest mountain on Venus, Maxwell Montes, is 20,000 feet high (8.8 kilometers), similar to the highest mountain on Earth, Mount Everest. The landscape is dusty, and surface temperatures reach a scalding 880 degrees Fahrenheit (471 degrees Celsius).</p><p>It is thought that Venus was completely resurfaced by volcanic activity 300 to 500 million years ago. Venus has two large highland areas: Ishtar Terra, about the size of Australia, in the north polar region; and Aphrodite Terra, about the size of South America, straddling the equator and extending for almost 6,000 miles (10,000 kilometers). <span><span> </span></span></p>  <p>Venus is covered in craters, but none are smaller than 0.9 to 1.2 miles (1.5 to 2 kilometers) across. Small meteoroids burn up in the dense atmosphere, so only large meteoroids reach the surface and create impact craters.</p>  <p>Almost all the surface features of Venus are named for noteworthy Earth women &mdash; both mythological and real. A volcanic crater is named for Sacajawea, the Native American woman who guided Lewis and Clark&#39;s exploration. A deep canyon is named for Diana, Roman goddess of the hunt. <span><span> </span></span></p>  <p><span class="mb_anchor_title">Atmosphere<a class="mb_anchor" name="atmosphere"></a></span></p>  <h3><span><b>Atmosphere</b></span></h3>  <p>Venus&#39; atmosphere consists mainly of carbon dioxide, with clouds of sulfuric acid droplets.

Speeds within the clouds decrease with cloud height, and at the surface are estimated to be just a few miles per hour. <span><span> </span></span></p>  <p>On the ground, it would look like a very hazy, overcast day on Earth.

    """<p><span><span>Our home planet is the third planet from the Sun, and the only place we know of so far that&rsquo;s inhabited by living things. While Earth is only the fifth largest planet in the solar system, it is the only world in our solar system with liquid water on the surface. Just slightly larger than nearby Venus, Earth is the biggest of the four planets closest to the Sun, all of which are made of rock and metal.</span></span></p>  <p><span><span>The name Earth is at least 1,000 years old. All of the planets, except for Earth, were named after Greek and Roman gods and goddesses.

This unit provides an easy way to quickly compare planets&#39; distances from the Sun. </span></span></p>  <p><span><span>It takes about eight minutes for light from the Sun to reach our planet.</span></span></p><h3><span><b>Orbit and Rotation</b></span></h3>  <p><span><span>As Earth orbits the Sun, it completes one rotation every 23.9 hours. It takes 365.25 days to complete one trip around the Sun. That extra quarter of a day presents a challenge to our calendar system, which counts one year as 365 days. To keep our yearly calendars consistent with our orbit around the Sun, every four years we add one day. That day is called a leap day, and the year it&#39;s added to is called a leap year. </span></span></p>  <p><span><span>Earth&#39;s axis of rotation is tilted 23.4 degrees with respect to the plane of Earth&#39;s orbit around the Sun. This tilt causes our yearly cycle of seasons. During part of the year, the northern hemisphere is tilted toward the Sun and the southern hemisphere is tilted away. With the Sun higher in the sky, solar heating is greater in the north producing summer there. Less direct solar heating produces winter in the south. Six months later, the situation is reversed. When spring and fall begin, both hemispheres receive roughly equal amounts of heat from the Sun.</span></span></p><h3>Structure</h3>  <p>Earth is composed of four main layers, starting with an inner core at the planet&#39;s center, enveloped by the outer core, mantle and crust.</p>  <p>The inner core is a solid sphere made of iron and nickel metals about 759 miles (1,221 kilometers) in radius. There the temperature is as high as 9,800 degrees Fahrenheit (5,400 degrees Celsius). Surrounding the inner core is the outer core. This layer is about 1,400 miles (2,300 kilometers) thick, made of iron and nickel fluids.</p>  <p>In between the outer core and crust is the mantle, the thickest layer. This hot, viscous mixture of molten rock is about 1,800 miles (2,900 kilometers) thick and has the consistency of caramel. The outermost layer, Earth&#39;s crust, goes about 19 miles (30 kilometers) deep on average on land. At the bottom of the ocean, the crust is thinner and extends about 3 miles (5 kilometers) from the sea floor to the top of the mantle.</p><h3><span><b>Formation</b></span></h3>  <p><span><span>When the solar system settled into its current layout about 4.5 billion years ago, Earth formed when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become the third planet from the Sun.

It has a solid and active surface with mountains, valleys, canyons, plains and so much more. Earth is special because it is an ocean planet. Water covers 70 percent of Earth&#39;s surface.</p>  <p>Earth&#39;s atmosphere is made mostly of nitrogen and has plenty of oxygen for us to breathe. The atmosphere also protects us from incoming meteoroids, most of which break up before they can hit the surface.</p><h3><span><b>Surface</b></span></h3>  <p><span><span>Like Mars and Venus, Earth has volcanoes, mountains and valleys. Earth&#39;s lithosphere, which includes the crust (both continental and oceanic) and the upper mantle, is divided into huge plates that are constantly moving. For example, the North American plate moves west over the Pacific Ocean basin, roughly at a rate equal to the growth of our fingernails. Earthquakes result when plates grind past one another, ride up over one another, collide to make mountains, or split and separate. </span></span></p>  <p><span><span>Earth&#39;s global ocean, which covers nearly 70 percent of the planet&#39;s surface, has an average depth of about 2.5 miles (4 kilometers) and contains 97 percent of Earth&#39;s water. Almost all of Earth&#39;s volcanoes are hidden under these oceans. Hawaii&#39;s Mauna Kea volcano is taller from base to summit than Mount Everest, but most of it is underwater. Earth&#39;s longest mountain range is also underwater, at the bottom of the Arctic and Atlantic oceans. It is four times longer than the Andes, Rockies and Himalayas combined.</span></span></p><h3><span><b>Atmosphere</b></span></h3>  <p><span><span>Near the surface, Earth has an atmosphere that consists of 78 percent nitrogen, 21 percent oxygen, and 1 percent other gases such as argon, carbon dioxide and neon. The atmosphere affects Earth&#39;s long-term climate and short-term local weather and shields us from much of the harmful radiation coming from the Sun. It also protects us from meteoroids, most of which burn up in the atmosphere, seen as meteors in the night sky, before they can strike the surface as meteorites.</span></span></p>  <p><span><span><span class="mb_anchor_title">Magnetosphere<a class="mb_anchor" name="magnetosphere"></a></span></span></span></p>  <h3>Magnetosphere</h3>  <p>Our planet&#39;s rapid rotation and molten nickel-iron core give rise to a magnetic field, which the solar wind distorts into a teardrop shape in space. (The solar wind is a stream of charged particles continuously ejected from the Sun.) When charged particles from the solar wind become trapped in Earth&#39;s magnetic field, they collide with air molecules above our planet&#39;s magnetic poles. These air molecules then begin to glow and cause aurorae, or the northern and southern lights.</p>  <p>The magnetic field is what causes compass needles to point to the North Pole regardless of which way you turn. But the magnetic polarity of Earth can change, flipping the direction of the magnetic field. The geologic record tells scientists that a magnetic reversal takes place about every 400,000 years on average, but the timing is very irregular. As far as we know, such a magnetic reversal doesn&#39;t cause any harm to life on Earth, and a reversal is very unlikely to happen for at least another thousand years. But when it does happen, compass needles are likely to point in many different directions for a few centuries while the switch is being made. And after the switch is completed, they will all point south instead of north.​</p>  <p><span class="mb_anchor_title">Rings<a class="mb_anchor" name="rings"></a></span></p>  <h3>Rings</h3>  <p>Earth has no rings.</p>  <p><span class="mb_anchor_title">Moons<a class="mb_anchor" name="moons"></a></span></p>  <h3>Moons</h3>  <p>Earth is the only planet that has a single moon.

They are typically trapped by Earth&#39;s gravity for a a few months or years before returning to an orbit around the Sun. Some asteroids will be in a long &ldquo;dance&rdquo; with Earth as both orbit the Sun.</p>  <p>Some moons are bits of rock that were captured by a planet&#39;s gravity, but our Moon is likely the result of a collision billions of years ago. When Earth was a young planet, a large chunk of rock smashed into it, displacing a portion of Earth&#39;s interior. The resulting chunks clumped together and formed our Moon. With a radius of 1,080 miles (1,738 kilometers), the Moon is the fifth largest moon in our solar system (after Ganymede, Titan, Callisto and Io).</p>  <p>The Moon is farther away from Earth than most people realize.

This crust is between 6 and 30 miles (10 to 50 kilometers) deep.</p>  <p><span class="mb_anchor_title">Formation<a class="mb_anchor" name="formation"></a></span></p>  <h2><span><b>Formation</b></span></h2>  <p><span><span>When the solar system settled into its current layout about 4.5 billion years ago, Mars formed when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become the fourth planet from the Sun. Mars is about half the size of Earth, and like its fellow terrestrial planets, it has a central core, a rocky mantle and a solid crust.</span></span></p>  <p><span class="mb_anchor_title">Surface<a class="mb_anchor" name="surface"></a></span></p>  <h2><span><b>Surface</b></span></h2>  <p><span><span>The Red Planet is actually many colors. At the surface we see colors such as brown, gold and tan. The reason Mars looks reddish is due to oxidization</span></span>&mdash;<span><span>or rusting</span>&mdash;<span>of iron in the rocks, regolith (Martian &ldquo;soil&rdquo;), and dust of Mars. This dust gets kicked up into the atmosphere and from a distance makes the planet appear mostly red.</span></span></p>  <p><span><span>Interestingly, while Mars is about half the diameter of Earth, its surface has nearly the same area as Earth&rsquo;s dry land. Its volcanoes, impact craters, crustal movement, and atmospheric conditions such as dust storms have altered the landscape of Mars over many years, creating some of the solar system&#39;s most interesting topographical features. </span></span></p>  <p><span><span>A large canyon system called Valles Marineris is long enough to stretch from California to New York</span></span>&mdash;<span><span>more than 3,000 miles (4,800 kilometers). This Martian canyon is 200 miles (320 kilometers) at its widest and 4.3 miles (7 kilometers) at its deepest. That&#39;s about 10 times the size of Earth&#39;s Grand Canyon.</span></span></p><p><span><span>Mars is home to the largest volcano in the solar system, Olympus Mons. It&#39;s three times taller than Earth&#39;s Mt. Everest with a base the size of the state of New Mexico.</span></span></p>  <p><span><span>Mars appears to have had a watery past, with ancient river valley networks, deltas and lakebeds, as well as rocks and minerals on the surface that could only have formed in liquid water. Some features suggest that Mars experienced huge floods about 3.5 billion years ago. </span></span></p>  <p><span><span>There is water on Mars today, but the Martian atmosphere is too thin for liquid water to exist for long on the surface. Today, water on Mars is found in the form of water-ice just under the surface in the polar regions as well as in briny (salty) water, which seasonally flows down some hillsides and crater walls.</span></span></p>  <p><span class="mb_anchor_title">Atmosphere<a class="mb_anchor" name="atmosphere"></a></span></p>  <h2><span><b>Atmosphere</b></span></h2>  <p><span><span>Mars has a thin atmosphere made up mostly of carbon dioxide, nitrogen and argon gases. To our eyes, the sky would be hazy and red because of suspended dust instead of the familiar blue tint we see on Earth. Mars&#39; sparse atmosphere doesn&#39;t offer much protection from impacts by such objects as meteorites, asteroids and comets.</span></span></p>  <p><span><span>The temperature on Mars can be as high as 70 degrees Fahrenheit (20 degrees Celsius) or as low as about -225 degrees Fahrenheit (-153 degrees Celsius). And because the atmosphere is so thin, heat from the Sun easily escapes this planet. If you were to stand on the surface of Mars on the equator at noon, it would feel like spring at your feet (75 degrees Fahrenheit or 24 degrees Celsius) and winter at your head (32 degrees Fahrenheit or 0 degrees Celsius).</span></span></p>  <p><span><span>Occasionally, winds on Mars are strong enough to create dust storms that cover much of the planet. After such storms, it can be months before all of the dust settles. </span></span></p>  <p><span><span><span class="mb_anchor_title">Magnetosphere<a class="mb_anchor" name="magnetosphere"></a></span></span></span></p>  <h2>Magnetosphere</h2>  <p>Mars has no global magnetic field today, but areas of the Martian crust in the southern hemisphere are highly magnetized, indicating traces of a magnetic field from 4 billion years ago.​</p>  <p><span class="mb_anchor_title">Rings<a class="mb_anchor" name="rings"></a></span></p>  <h2>Rings</h2>  <p>Mars has no rings.

    """<p>Jupiter is the fifth planet from our Sun and is, by far, the largest planet in the solar system</span><span> &ndash; more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined. Jupiter&#39;s stripes and swirls are actually cold, windy clouds of ammonia and water, floating in an atmosphere of hydrogen and helium. Jupiter&rsquo;s iconic Great Red Spot is a giant storm bigger than Earth that has raged for hundreds of years.</span></span></p><p><span>Jupiter is surrounded by dozens of moons. Jupiter also has several rings, but unlike the famous rings of Saturn, Jupiter&rsquo;s rings are very faint and made of dust, not ice.</span></p><h3>Exploration</h3>  <p>Nine spacecraft have studied Jupiter up close. <span>NASA&#39;s <a href="/missions/juno/in-depth/">Juno</a> spacecraft is currently studying the gas giant planet from orbit. The spacecraft, which arrived at Jupiter in July </span><span>2016, is the first </span>to study the planet&#39;s mysterious, cloud-shrouded interior. Scientists also use the Earth-orbiting <a href="/missions/hubble-space-telescope/in-depth/">Hubble Space Telescope</a> and ground-based telescopes to regularly check in on Jupiter.</p><p>Jupiter holds a unique place in the history of space exploration. In 1610, astronomer Galileo Galilei used a new invention called the telescope to look at Jupiter and discovered the first moons known to exist beyond Earth. The discovery ended incorrect, ancient belief that everything, including the Sun and other planets, orbited the Earth.</p><h3><span><b>Size and Distance</b></span></h3>  <p><span><span>With a radius of 43,440.7 miles (69,911 kilometers), Jupiter is 11 times wider than Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Jupiter would be about as big as a basketball. </span></span></p>  <p><span><span>From an average distance of 484 million miles (778 million kilometers), Jupiter is 5.2 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes Sunlight 43 minutes to travel from the Sun to Jupiter.</span></span></p><h3><span><b>Orbit and Rotation</b></span></h3>  <p><span><span>Jupiter has the shortest day in the solar system. One day on Jupiter takes only about 10 hours (the time it takes for Jupiter to rotate or spin around once), and Jupiter makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Jovian time) in about 12 Earth years (4,333 Earth days). </span></span></p>  <p><span><span>Its equator is tilted with respect to its orbital path around the Sun by just 3 degrees. This means Jupiter spins nearly upright and does not have seasons as extreme as other planets do. </span></span></p>  <p><span class="mb_anchor_title">Structure<a class="mb_anchor" name="structure"></a></span></p>  <h3>Structure</h3>  <p>The composition of Jupiter is similar to that of the Sun&mdash;mostly hydrogen and helium. Deep in the atmosphere, pressure and temperature increase, compressing the hydrogen gas into a liquid. This gives Jupiter the largest ocean in the solar system&mdash;an ocean made of hydrogen instead of water. Scientists think that, at depths perhaps halfway to the planet&#39;s center, the pressure becomes so great that electrons are squeezed off the hydrogen atoms, making the liquid electrically conducting like metal. Jupiter&#39;s fast rotation is thought to drive electrical currents in this region, generating the planet&#39;s powerful magnetic field. It is still unclear if, deeper down, Jupiter has a central core of solid material or if it may be a thick, super-hot and dense soup. It could be up to 90,032 degrees Fahrenheit (50,000 degrees Celsius) down there, made mostly of iron and silicate minerals (similar to quartz).</p>  <p><span class="mb_anchor_title">Formation<a class="mb_anchor" name="formation"></a></span></p>  <h3>Formation</h3>  <p>Jupiter took shape when the rest of the solar system formed about 4.5 billion years ago, when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become this gas giant. Jupiter took most of the mass left over after the formation of the Sun, ending up with more than twice the combined material of the other bodies in the solar system. In fact, Jupiter has the same ingredients as a star, but it did not grow massive enough to ignite.</p>  <p>About 4 billion years ago, Jupiter settled into its current position in the outer solar system, where it is the fifth planet from the Sun.</p>  <p><span class="mb_anchor_title">Surface<a class="mb_anchor" name="surface"></a></span></p>  <h3>Surface</h3>  <p>As a gas giant, Jupiter doesn&rsquo;t have a true surface. The planet is mostly swirling gases and liquids. While a spacecraft would have nowhere to land on Jupiter, it wouldn&rsquo;t be able to fly through unscathed either. The extreme pressures and temperatures deep inside the planet crush, melt and vaporize spacecraft trying to fly into the planet.</p>  <p><span class="mb_anchor_title">Atmosphere<a class="mb_anchor" name="atmosphere"></a></span></p>  <h3>Atmosphere</h3>  <p>Jupiter&#39;s appearance is a tapestry of colorful cloud bands and spots. The gas planet likely has three distinct cloud layers in its &quot;skies&quot; that, taken together, span about 44 miles (71 kilometers). The top cloud is probably made of ammonia ice, while the middle layer is likely made of ammonium hydrosulfide crystals. The innermost layer may be made of water ice and vapor.</p>  <p>The vivid colors you see in thick bands across Jupiter may be plumes of sulfur and phosphorus-containing gases rising from the planet&#39;s warmer interior. Jupiter&#39;s fast rotation&mdash;spinning once every 10 hours&mdash;creates strong jet streams, separating its clouds into dark belts and bright zones across long stretches.</p>  <p>With no solid surface to slow them down, Jupiter&#39;s spots can persist for many years. Stormy Jupiter is swept by over a dozen prevailing winds, some reaching up to 335 miles per hour (539 kilometers per hour) at the equator. The Great Red Spot, a swirling oval of clouds twice as wide as Earth, has been observed on the giant planet for more than 300 years. More recently, three smaller ovals merged to form the Little Red Spot, about half the size of its larger cousin. Scientists do not yet know if these ovals and planet-circling bands are shallow or deeply rooted to the interior.</p>  <p><span class="mb_anchor_title">Magnetosphere<a class="mb_anchor" name="magnetosphere"></a></span></p>  <h3>Magnetosphere</h3>  <p>The Jovian magnetosphere is the region of space influenced by Jupiter&#39;s powerful magnetic field. It balloons 600,000 to 2 million miles (1 to 3 million kilometers) toward the Sun (seven to 21 times the diameter or Jupiter itself) and tapers into a tadpole-shaped tail extending more than 600 million miles (1 billion kilometers) behind Jupiter, as far as Saturn&#39;s orbit. Jupiter&#39;s enormous magnetic field is 16 to 54 times as powerful as that of the Earth. It rotates with the planet and sweeps up particles that have an electric charge. Near the planet, the magnetic field traps swarms of charged particles and accelerates them to very high energies, creating intense radiation that bombards the innermost moons and can damage spacecraft.</p>  <p>Jupiter&#39;s magnetic field also causes some of the solar system&#39;s most spectacular aurorae at the planet&#39;s poles.</p>  <p><span class="mb_anchor_title">Rings<a class="mb_anchor" name="rings"></a></span></p>  <h3>Rings</h3>  <p>Discovered in 1979 by NASA&#39;s Voyager 1 spacecraft, Jupiter&#39;s rings were a surprise, as they are composed of small, dark particles and are difficult to see except when backlit by the Sun. Data from the Galileo spacecraft indicate that Jupiter&#39;s ring system may be formed by dust kicked up as interplanetary meteoroids smash into the giant planet&#39;s small innermost moons.</p>  <p><span class="mb_anchor_title">Moons<a class="mb_anchor" name="moons"></a></span></p>  <h3>Moons</h3>  <p>With four large moons and many smaller moons, Jupiter forms a kind of miniature solar system. Jupiter has 53 confirmed moons and 26 provisional moons awaiting confirmation of discovery. Moons are named after they are confirmed. </p>  <p>Jupiter&#39;s four largest moons&mdash;Io, Europa, Ganymede and Callisto&mdash;were first observed by the astronomer Galileo Galilei in 1610 using an early version of the telescope. These four moons are known today as the Galilean satellites, and they&#39;re some of the most fascinating destinations in our solar system. Io is the most volcanically active body in the solar system. Ganymede is the largest moon in the solar system (even bigger than the planet Mercury). Callisto&rsquo;s very few small craters indicate a small degree of current surface activity. A liquid-water ocean with the ingredients for life may lie beneath the frozen crust of Europa, making it a tempting place to explore.</p> <h3>Potential for Life</h3>  <p>Jupiter&rsquo;s environment is probably not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures, pressures and materials that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms to adapt to.</p>  <p>While planet Jupiter is an unlikely place for living things to take hold, the same is not true of some of its many moons. Europa is one of the likeliest places to find life elsewhere in our solar system. There is evidence of a vast ocean just beneath its icy crust, where life could possibly be supported.</p><br><br><h2 class='sidebar_title'> Quick Facts </h2><p><b>Namesake:</b> King of the ancient Roman gods</p>  <hr /> <p><b>Discovered:</b> Known to the ancients</p>  <hr /> <p><b>Planet type: </b><span>Gas Giant</span></p>  <hr /> <p><b>Number of moons:</b><span> 53 confirmed | 26 provisional (<a href="/moons/jupiter-moons/overview/">79 total)</a></span></p>  <hr /> <p><span><b>Rings</b>: Yes</span></p>  <hr /> <p><b>Diameter:</b> 88,846 miles (142,984 kilometers)</p>  <hr /> <p><b>Length of day:</b> 9.93 hours</p>  <hr /> <p><b>Length of year:</b> 11.86 Earth Years</p>  <hr /> <p><b>Distance from Sun:</b> 5.1 Astronomical Units (Earth=1)</p>  <hr /> <p><b>Volume:</b> 1,321 (Earth=1)</p>  <hr /> <p><b>Mass: </b>318 (Earth=1)</p>  <hr /> <p><b>Surface temperature*:</b> -160 <span>degrees Fahrenheit</span> (-110 <span>degrees Celsius</span>)</p>  <hr /> </p>

This hexagon-shaped pattern was first noticed in images from the Voyager I spacecraft and has been more closely observed by the Cassini spacecraft since. Spanning about 20,000 miles (30,000 kilometers) across, the hexagon is a wavy jet stream of 200-mile-per-hour winds (about 322 kilometers per hour) with a massive, rotating storm at the center.

Saturn, the rings, and many of the satellites lie totally within Saturn&#39;s enormous magnetosphere, the region of space in which the behavior of electrically charged particles is influenced more by Saturn&#39;s magnetic field than by the solar wind.</p>  <p>Aurorae occur when charged particles spiral into a planet&#39;s atmosphere along magnetic field lines. On Earth, these charged particles come from the solar wind. Cassini showed that at least some of Saturn&#39;s aurorae are like Jupiter&#39;s and are largely unaffected by the solar wind. Instead, these aurorae are caused by a combination of particles ejected from Saturn&#39;s moons and Saturn&#39;s magnetic field&#39;s rapid rotation rate. But these &quot;non-solar-originating&quot; aurorae are not completely understood yet.</p>  <p><span class="mb_anchor_title">Rings<a class="mb_anchor" name="rings"></a></span></p>  <h3>Rings</h3>  <p>Saturn&#39;s rings are thought to be pieces of comets, asteroids or shattered moons that broke up before they reached the planet, torn apart by Saturn&#39;s powerful gravity. They are made of billions of small chunks of ice and rock coated with another material such as dust. The ring particles mostly range from tiny, dust-sized icy grains to chunks as big as a house. A few particles are as large as mountains. The rings would look mostly white if you looked at them from the cloud tops of Saturn, and interestingly, each ring orbits at a different speed around the planet.</p>  <p>Saturn&#39;s ring system extends up to 175,000 miles (282,000 kilometers) from the planet, yet the vertical height is typically about 30 feet (10 meters) in the main rings. Named alphabetically in the order they were discovered, the rings are relatively close to each other, with the exception of a gap measuring 2,920 miles (4,700 kilometers) wide called the Cassini Division that separates Rings A and B. The main rings are A, B and C.

And unlike any other planet, Uranus rotates on its side.</p><h3><span><b>Surface</b></span></h3>  <p><span><span>As an ice giant, Uranus doesn&rsquo;t have a true surface. The planet is mostly swirling fluids. While a spacecraft would have nowhere to land on Uranus, it wouldn&rsquo;t be able to fly through its atmosphere unscathed either. The extreme pressures and temperatures would destroy a metal spacecraft. </span></span></p><h3><span><b>Atmosphere</b></span></h3>  <p><span><span>Uranus&#39; atmosphere is mostly hydrogen and helium, with a small amount of methane and traces of water and ammonia. The methane gives Uranus its signature blue color.</span></span></p>  <p><span><span>While Voyager 2 saw only a few discrete clouds, a Great Dark Spot and a small dark spot during its flyby in 1986, more recent observations reveal that Uranus exhibits dynamic clouds as it approaches equinox, including rapidly changing bright features. </span></span></p>  <p><span><span>Uranus&#39; planetary atmosphere, with a minimum temperature of 49K (-224.2 degrees Celsius) makes it even colder than Neptune in some places. </span></span></p>  <p><span><span>Wind speeds can reach up to 560 miles per hour (900 kilometers per hour) on Uranus. Winds are retrograde at the equator, blowing in the reverse direction of the planet&rsquo;s rotation. But closer to the poles, winds shift to a prograde direction, flowing with Uranus&#39; rotation. </span></span></p>  <p><span class="mb_anchor_title">Magnetosphere<a class="mb_anchor" name="magnetosphere"></a></span></p>  <h3>Magnetosphere</h3>  <p>Uranus has an unusual, irregularly shaped magnetosphere. Magnetic fields are typically in alignment with a planet&#39;s rotation, but Uranus&#39; magnetic field is tipped over: the magnetic axis is tilted nearly 60 degrees from the planet&#39;s axis of rotation, and is also offset from the center of the planet by one-third of the planet&#39;s radius.</p>  <p>Auroras on Uranus are not in line with the poles (like they are on Earth, Jupiter and Saturn) due to the lopsided magnetic field.</p>  <p>The magnetosphere tail behind Uranus opposite the Sun extends into space for millions of miles. Its magnetic field lines are twisted by Uranus&rsquo; sideways rotation into a long corkscrew shape.</p>  <p><span class="mb_anchor_title">Rings<a class="mb_anchor" name="rings"></a></span></p>  <h3>Rings</h3>  <p>Uranus has two sets of rings. The inner system of nine rings consists mostly of narrow, dark grey rings. There are two outer rings: the innermost one is reddish like dusty rings elsewhere in the solar system, and the outer ring is blue like Saturn&#39;s E ring.  </p>  <p>In order of increasing distance from the planet, the rings are called Zeta, 6, 5, 4, Alpha, Beta, Eta, Gamma, Delta, Lambda, Epsilon, Nu and Mu. Some of the larger rings are surrounded by belts of fine dust.</p>  <p><span class="mb_anchor_title">Moons<a class="mb_anchor" name="moons"></a></span></p>  <h3>Moons</h3>  <p>Uranus has 27 known moons. While most of the satellites orbiting other planets take their names from Greek or Roman mythology, Uranus&#39; moons are unique in being named for characters from the works of William Shakespeare and Alexander Pope.</p>  <p>All of Uranus&#39; inner moons appear to be roughly half water ice and half rock. The composition of the outer moons remains unknown, but they are likely captured asteroids.</p>  <p><span class="mb_anchor_title">Potential for Life<a class="mb_anchor" name="potential_for_life"></a></span></p>  <h3><span><b>Potential for Life</b></span></h3>  <p><span><span>Uranus&#39; environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures, pressures and materials that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms to adapt to. </span></span></p>  </div> </div> <div id='secondary_column'> <aside class='boxed'> <header> <h2 class='sidebar_title'> Quick Facts </h2> </header> <div class='advanced_sidebar_body'> <p><b>Day</b><br /> 17 hours 14 minutes</p>  <p><b>Year</b><br /> 84 Earth years</p>  <p><b>Radius</b><br /> 15,759.2 miles | 25,362 kilometers</p>  <p><b>Planet Type</b><br /> Ice Giant</p>  <p><b>Moons</b><br /> 27</p> </div> </aside>  </div> </article>""",
    """<p>Dark, cold and whipped by supersonic winds, ice giant Neptune is the eighth and most distant planet in our solar system. More than 30 times as far from the Sun as Earth, Neptune is the only planet in our solar system not visible to the naked eye. In 2011 Neptune completed its first 165-year orbit since its discovery in 1846</p><p><span><span>Neptune is so far from the Sun that high noon on the big blue planet would seem like dim twilight to us. The warm light we see here on our home planet is roughly 900 times as bright as sunlight on Neptune.</span></span></p>  <p><span><span>The ice giant Neptune was the first planet located through mathematical calculations. Using predictions made by Urbain Le Verrier, Johann Galle discovered the planet in 1846. The planet is named after the Roman god of the sea, as suggested by Le Verrier</span></span></p><h3><span><b>Size and Distance</b></span></h3>  <p><span><span>With a radius of 15,299.4 miles (24,622 kilometers), Neptune is about four times wider than Earth. If Earth were the size of a nickel, Neptune would be about as big as a baseball.</span></span></p>  <p><span><span>From an average distance of 2.8 billion miles (4.5 billion kilometers), Neptune is 30 astronomical units away from the Sun. One astronomical unit (abbreviated as AU), is the distance from the Sun to Earth. From this distance, it takes sunlight 4 hours to travel from the Sun to Neptune.</span></span></p> <h3><span><b>Orbit and Rotation</b></span></h3>  <p><span><span>One day on Neptune takes about 16 hours (the time it takes for Neptune to rotate or spin once). And Neptune makes a complete orbit around the Sun (a year in Neptunian time) in about 165 Earth years (60,190 Earth days).</span></span></p>  <p><span><span>Sometimes Neptune is even farther from the Sun than dwarf planet Pluto. Pluto&#39;s highly eccentric, oval-shaped orbit brings it inside Neptune&#39;s orbit for a 20-year period every 248 Earth years. This switch, in which Pluto is closer to the Sun than Neptune, happened most recently from 1979 to 1999. Pluto can never crash into Neptune, though, because for every three laps Neptune takes around the Sun, Pluto makes two. This repeating pattern prevents close approaches of the two bodies.</span></span></p>  <p><span><span>Neptune&rsquo;s axis of rotation is tilted 28 degrees with respect to the plane of its orbit around the Sun, which is similar to the axial tilts of Mars and Earth. This means that Neptune experiences seasons just like we do on Earth; however, since its year is so long, each of the four seasons lasts for over 40 years</span></span>.</p><h3>Structure</h3>  <p>Neptune is one of two ice giants in the outer solar system (the other is Uranus). Most (80 percent or more) of the planet&#39;s mass is made up of a hot dense fluid of &quot;icy&quot; materials&mdash;water, methane and ammonia&mdash;above a small, rocky core. Of the giant planets, Neptune is the densest.</p>  <p>Scientists think there might be an ocean of super hot water under Neptune&#39;s cold clouds. It does not boil away because incredibly high pressure keeps it locked inside.</p>  <p><span class="mb_anchor_title">Formation<a class="mb_anchor" name="formation"></a></span></p>  <h3><span><b>Formation</b></span></h3>  <p><span><span>Neptune took shape when the rest of the solar system formed about 4.5 billion years ago, when gravity pulled swirling gas and dust in to become this ice giant. Like its neighbor Uranus, Neptune likely formed closer to the Sun and moved to the outer solar system about 4 billion years ago. </span></span></p>  <p><span class="mb_anchor_title">Surface<a class="mb_anchor" name="surface"></a></span></p>  <h3><span><b>Surface</b></span></h3>  <p><span><span>Neptune does not have a solid surface. Its atmosphere (made up mostly of hydrogen, helium and methane) extends to great depths, gradually merging into water and other melted ices over a heavier, solid core with about the same mass as Earth.</span></span></p>  <p><span class="mb_anchor_title">Atmosphere<a class="mb_anchor" name="atmosphere"></a></span></p>  <h3><span><b>Atmosphere</b></span></h3>  <p><span><span>Neptune&#39;s atmosphere is made up mostly of hydrogen and helium with just a little bit of methane. Neptune&#39;s neighbor Uranus is a blue-green color due to such atmospheric methane, but Neptune is a more vivid, brighter blue, so there must be an unknown component that causes the more intense color.</span></span></p>  <p><span><span>Neptune is our solar system&#39;s windiest world. Despite its great distance and low energy input from the Sun, Neptune&#39;s winds can be three times stronger than Jupiter&#39;s and nine times stronger than Earth&#39;s. These winds whip clouds of frozen methane across the planet at speeds of more than 1,200 miles per hour (2,000 kilometers per hour). Even Earth&#39;s most powerful winds hit only about 250 miles per hour (400 kilometers per hour).</span></span></p>  <p><span><span>In 1989 a large, oval-shaped storm in Neptune&#39;s southern hemisphere dubbed the &quot;Great Dark Spot&quot; was large enough to contain the entire Earth. That storm has since disappeared, but new ones have appeared on different parts of the planet.</span></span></p>  <p><span class="mb_anchor_title">Magnetosphere<a class="mb_anchor" name="magnetosphere"></a></span></p>  <h3>Magnetosphere</h3>  <p>The main axis of Neptune&#39;s magnetic field is tipped over by about 47 degrees compared with the planet&#39;s rotation axis. Like Uranus, whose magnetic axis is tilted about 60 degrees from the axis of rotation, Neptune&#39;s magnetosphere undergoes wild variations during each rotation because of this misalignment. The magnetic field of Neptune is about 27 times more powerful than that of Earth.​</p><h3><span><b>Rings</b></span></h3>  <p><span><span>Neptune at least five main rings and four prominient ring arcs that we know of so far. Starting near the planet and moving outward, the main rings are named Galle, Leverrier, Lassell, Arago and Adams. The rings are thought to be relatively young and short-lived. </span></span></p>  <p><span><span>Neptune&#39;s ring system also has peculiar clumps of dust called arcs. Four prominent arcs named Libert&eacute; (Liberty), Egalit&eacute; (Equality), Fraternit&eacute; (Fraternity) and Courage are in the outermost ring, Adams. The arcs are strange because the laws of motion would predict that they would spread out evenly rather than stay clumped together. Scientists now think the gravitational effects of Galatea, a moon just inward from the ring, stabilizes these arcs. </span></span></p><h3><b>Moons</b></h3>  <p>Neptune has 14 known moons. Neptune&#39;s largest moon Triton was discovered on October 10, 1846, by William Lassell, just 17 days after Johann Gottfried Galle discovered the planet. Since Neptune was named for the Roman god of the sea, its moons are named for various lesser sea gods and nymphs in Greek mythology.</p>  <p>Triton is the only large moon in the solar system that circles its planet in a direction opposite to the planet&#39;s rotation (a retrograde orbit), which suggests that it may once have been an independent object that Neptune captured. Triton is extremely cold, with surface temperatures around minus 391 degrees Fahrenheit (minus 235 degrees Celsius). And yet, despite this deep freeze at Triton, Voyager 2 discovered geysers spewing icy material upward more than 5 miles (8 kilometers). Triton&#39;s thin atmosphere, also discovered by Voyager, has been detected from Earth several times since, and is growing warmer, but scientists do not yet know why.</p><h3>Potential for Life</h3>  <p>Neptune&#39;s environment is not conducive to life as we know it. The temperatures, pressures and materials that characterize this planet are most likely too extreme and volatile for organisms to adapt to.</p><h2 class='sidebar_title'> Quick Facts </h2> </header> <div class='advanced_sidebar_body'> <p><b>Day</b><br /> 16 hours</p>  <p><b>Year</b><br /> 165 Earth years</p>  <p><b>Radius</b><br /> 15,299.4 miles | 24,622 kilometers</p>  <p><b>Planet Type</b><br /> Ice Giant</p>  <p><b>Moons</b><br /> <span><span>14</span></span></p>"""
