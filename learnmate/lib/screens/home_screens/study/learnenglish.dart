    """<h2 id="section---WhatIsAPronoun">What Is a Pronoun?</h2><p>A <b>pronoun</b> is not a professional noun. It is a short word that is used in place of a noun. Many times pronouns are used to prevent the writer from having to repeat the name of the noun over and over again. It is important that the noun you are replacing with a pronoun is already known to avoid confusion. </p><p>You use pronouns every day and in almost every sentence you speak. Every time you say 'I' or 'you' or 'me,' you're using a pronoun. Pronouns are so common that you probably don't even realize how many you use in a day. The role of the noun in the sentence determines what kind of a pronoun you use. </p><h2 id="section---SubjectPronouns">Subject Pronouns</h2><p><b>Subject pronouns</b> take the place of nouns that are the subject of the sentence. The <b>subject</b> is the person, place or thing that the sentence is about. </p><p>Let's look at the sentence: </p><ul>  <li>The barn is painted red. </li> </ul><p>The subject of this sentence is 'the barn' because the sentence is about the barn. </p><p>Now let's say we want a second sentence with the barn as the subject. Instead of repeating the words 'the barn' again, we can use the subject pronoun, 'it,' to replace 'the barn.' So now we would have the following sentences: </p><ul>  <li>The barn is painted red. It is down the street from me. </li> </ul><p>If you are replacing a person with a subject pronoun, you would use 'he' or 'she.' If you are speaking about yourself, you would use 'I.' If you are using the second person, you would use 'you.' If you are replacing a group of people, the correct pronoun would be either 'we' or 'they.' </p><h2 id="section---ObjectPronouns">Object Pronouns</h2><p><b>Object pronouns</b> take the place of the object of the sentence. The <b>object</b> is the noun that is acted on by the subject of the sentence. </p><p>In the sentence: </p><ul>  <li>The boy kicks the ball. </li> </ul><p>the object is 'the ball' becaus 'the boy' is the subject, and he is acting on the ball by kicking it. Now, if you want to use a pronoun for the object of this sentence ('the ball'), you would use 'it,' just like you do with the subject pronoun. The sentence would now read: </p><ul>  <li>The boy kicks it. </li> </ul><p>The pronoun 'it' is used for basic nouns whether they are the subject or the object. </p><p>Let's try the sentence: </p><ul>  <li>The boy plays with Sally. </li> </ul><p>If we want to use a pronoun for the object of the sentence, 'Sally,' we would use the pronoun 'her.' So our new sentence would be: </p><ul>  <li>The boy plays with her. </li> </ul><h2 id="section---ExamplesOfPronouns">Examples of Pronouns</h2><p>Here are some examples of subject and object pronouns. In the first column, you can see the subject pronouns. The second column shows the object pronouns. </p><p></p><table class="wikitable" border="1">  <tbody>   <tr class="odd">    <th>Subject Pronoun</th>    <th> Object Pronoun</th>   </tr>    <tr>    <td>I</td>    <td>me</td>   </tr>    <tr class="odd">    <td>you</td>    <td>you</td>   </tr>    <tr>    <td>she</td>    <td>her</td>   </tr>    <tr class="odd">    <td>he</td>    <td>him</td>   </tr>    <tr>    <td>we</td>    <td>us</td>   </tr>    <tr class="odd">    <td>they</td>    <td>them</td>   </tr>   </tbody> </table><h2 id="section---LessonSummary">Lesson Summary</h2><p>Pronouns take the place of nouns. They can be used to prevent the repeating of the noun in a sentence. They are divided into two groups: subject pronouns and object pronouns. <b>Subject pronouns</b> take the place of nouns that are the subject of the sentence. A <b>subject</b> is a person, place, or thing that the sentence is about. <b>Object pronouns</b> take the place of the object of the sentence.

<h2 id="section---ExploringInterjectionsDefinitionsAndExamples">Exploring Interjections: Definitions and Examples</h2><p>When children say 'Yuk!' they mean they don't want to taste, touch, see, feel, or smell something again. It is a word that means bad, ugly, nasty, or even horrible, and it is an example of an interjection. </p><p>Some people say that a picture is worth a thousand words, and so are <b>interjections</b>, because they convey strong emotions without being connected to a main idea. They are words that do not need a subject or verb to relay meaning. They can also exaggerate feelings. 'Yuk' is an example of an interjection used when the speaker is exaggerating their dislike or when the speaker is grossed out or disgusted. </p><p>Interjections are described as: </p><ul>  <li>Words or sounds used to express strong emotion in writing or speech </li>  <li>Grammatical parts of speech, but not part of the sentence's subject and predicate </li>  <li>Potentially part of the sentence's structure </li> </ul><p>Notice the position of the interjection in the first diagram, then notice the interjection 'Holy cow!' illustrated in the second diagram—it is placed above the main idea. It's part of the sentence's structure, but not a grammatical part of the sentence. </p><h2 id="section---PunctuatingInterjections">Punctuating Interjections</h2><p>Interjections may still affect the mood or tone of a sentence depending on how they are punctuated. When an interjection is independent of the main clause, it is written with an exclamation point after it. Most of the time, this type of interjection is written at the beginning of the sentence. For example: </p><ul>  <li>Yikes! I wasn't expecting you. </li>  <li>Geez! It's too cold. </li>  <li>Hmm! I didn't think of that. </li>  <li>Oops! I spilled the milk. </li> </ul><p>'Yikes,' 'Geez,' 'Hmm' and 'Oops' are interjections that relay the author's tone or express how the author feels. The sentences written after them are statements that show facts or opinions. When an interjection is written into the structure of a sentence to express mood or feeling for the whole sentence, it is typically punctuated with a comma. </p><ul>  <li>Phillip, wait, I haven't finished yet! </li>  <li>At last, the food is served. </li> </ul><p>In the first example, 'wait' makes a pause in the sentence, cautioning Phillip. While in the second example, 'at last,' conveys a feeling of satisfaction that the food is finally served. </p> 		</div><div class="hidden" ng-non-bindable><h2 id="section---ChoosingAnInterjection">Choosing An Interjection</h2><p>Interjections are not random. Every interjection has a meaning. You would not say, for instance, oops, yikes, or golly if you turned in your homework on time, but you might use those expressions if you turned in your homework late. For example, 'Yuk! I like that carrot' doesn't sound right. However, 'Mmmm! I like that carrot' sounds correct. </p><p>It's important to know what meaning an interjection conveys before deciding to use one. Let's look at a list of meanings for commonly used expressions: </p><ul>  <li>Aah: Exclamation of fear </li>  <li>Ahh: Realization or acceptance </li>  <li>Aww: Something sweet or cute </li>  <li>Bingo: Acknowledge something as right </li>  <li>Eh: Question something </li>  <li>Eww: Something disgusting </li>  <li>Hmph: Indicate displeasure </li>  <li>Oh: I see and/or I think </li>  <li>Oops: Making a mistake </li>  <li>Ouch: Exclamation of pain </li>  <li>Shh: Indication for silence </li>  <li>Uh oh: Showing dismay </li>  <li>Whew: Amazement and/or relief </li>  <li>Wow: Surprise or admiration </li>  <li>Yay: Congratulatory exclamation </li>  <li>Yeah: Variant of 'yes' </li>  <li>Yikes: Fear or concern (not serious) </li>  <li>Yippee: Exclamation of celebration </li>  <li>Uh: Indicating a pause or need for more time </li>  <li>Hmm: Thinking and/or hesitating about something </li>  <li>Er: Not knowing what to say </li>  <li>Um: Pausing or being skeptical </li> </ul><h2 id="section---LessonSummary">Lesson Summary</h2><p><b>Interjections</b> are parts of speech that communicate strong emotions. Grammatically, these words are not always part of the sentence, but they may affect the tone or mood within a sentence. When an interjection conveys an author's tone, it is usually punctuated with an exclamation mark and placed before a complete sentence that conveys opinion or fact. However, when it is part of the sentence's structure used to express a mood, it may be written anywhere in the sentence, separated by commas. </p><p>Choose interjections by the emotion you want to convey as well as what you want the interjection to do for the main idea of your sentence. Use an interjection and let the reader know how you feel, but be careful to send the right message!</p></div>""",
    """<h2 id="section---DefinitionOfConjunctions">Definition of Conjunctions</h2><p>Imagine a world without conjunctions. I dare you to try. Isolated ideas strung together all willy-nilly. Words crashing into each other without purpose or reason. Sentences confused and unsure of where to turn. 'Horrifying' barely describes it. Have no fear. Luckily, this nightmare world does not exist thanks to the power of the <b>conjunction</b>. </p><p>Conjunctions help make the world right mostly because their function is to join, link and transition words, phrases and clauses in our writing. There are three types of conjunctions: coordinating, subordinating and correlative. </p><p>The most common of these, the <b>coordinating conjunction</b>, is used to coordinate or join words, phrases and clauses. Coordinating conjunctions include: for, and, nor, but, or, yet and so. One way that I always remember these conjunctions is the acronym FANBOYS. I always imagine some boy band from the '90s: 'Tonight…one time only…live…the FANBOYS!!!' And, but, or and so are definitely the most popular of the FANBOYS, but the others serve their purpose and can be very helpful when needed. </p><p><b>Subordinating conjunctions</b> are used to subordinate clauses or make them dependent on an independent clause. An <b>independent clause</b> is another word for a sentence. It has a subject and a verb, and it can stand on its own as a complete thought. A <b>subordinate clause</b> also has a subject and a verb, but it cannot stand alone because it is an incomplete sentence. It needs an independent clause to make it complete. Subordinating conjunctions also help transition ideas or events between these clauses by showing a change in time, place or event. These conjunctions include: as, although, after, before, because, if, since, though, whenever, while, until and when. </p><p>Finally, the <b>correlative conjunction</b>, the rarest of conjunctions, correlates or connects two ideas and always travels in pairs. These include: either/or, neither/nor, both/and and not only/but also. </p><h2 id="section---Examples">Examples</h2><p>Let's take a look at some examples. </p><p><b>Coordinating conjunctions</b> can join: </p><p>Words… </p><p><i>In a perfect world, I could eat jelly beans AND chocolate all day long without gaining any weight.</i> </p><p>Phrases… </p><p><i>I would never have to exercise OR go to the gym.</i> </p><p>And clauses… </p><p><i>I would burn calories by sitting on the couch, AND sweatpants would be perfectly acceptable clothing for the workplace.</i> </p><p><b>Subordinating conjunctions</b> are used at the beginning of a subordinate clause and help link or transition to an independent clause. They make one clause subordinate or dependent on the other. </p><p><i>AFTER I ate an entire bag of jelly beans, I felt horrible.</i> </p><p>Here the subordinating conjunction, 'after,' begins a subordinate clause and helps explain why the person feels so horrible. </p><p><i>I have to go to the dentist SINCE I have been eating jelly beans every day this week.</i> </p><p>Here the subordinating conjunction, 'since,' begins the subordinate clause and explains why the person must visit the dentist. </p><p><i>WHENEVER I cannot see my feet, I know that I have overdone it again on the jelly beans.</i> </p><p>The subordinating conjunction, 'whenever,' helps show the relationship between overdosing on jelly beans and not being able to see one's feet. </p><p><b>Correlative conjunctions</b> always appear in pairs and include: either/or, neither/nor, both/and and not only/but also. </p><p><i>EITHER you take these jelly beans away from me, OR I will continue to devour them daily.</i> </p><p><i>NEITHER you NOR I know why I have become addicted to these colorful little morsels.</i> </p><p><i>NOT ONLY do I love wearing sweatpants, BUT I ALSO might replace all of my pants' waists with elastic bands.</i> </p><p>These last conjunctions definitely aren't as common, but they can be very useful in one's writing. </p><h2 id="section---LessonSummary">Lesson Summary</h2><p><b>Conjunctions</b> help make the world right, mostly because their function is to join, link and transition words, phrases and clauses in our writing.

    """<h2 id="section---WhatIsAnAdjective">What is an Adjective?</h2><p>An <b>adjective</b> is a word that describes a <b>noun</b>, which is a person, place, or thing, or a state of being, usually the subject of a sentence. An adjective tells us what something is like. Imagine a world of conversation where no one ever described anything. </p><p>On the news this morning, there was a story about a tractor parts factory that had been torn to bits by a tornado. Workers hid in the bathroom and remained safe. The news reporter asked one of them, 'What was it like? What did you hear? What did it feel like?' If there were no adjectives, or describing words, we would have no idea what the worker had experienced. Here are some examples of how an adjective describes a noun: </p><ul>  <li>'The worker was terrified.' The adjective 'terrified' describes the noun worker. </li>  <li>'He heard loud, crashing sounds.' The adjectives 'loud' and 'crashing' describe the noun sounds. </li>  <li>'Nature was angry, violent, and destructive.' The adjectives 'angry,' 'violent' and 'destructive' describe the noun 'nature.' </li> </ul><p>When you use adjectives, you describe a scene in specific <b>details</b>, allowing the reader to experience the scene as if he or she was there with you when you did. If you are using specific or descriptive details in describing a kitchen, you don't just say, 'There was a table.' You might say, 'There was an old, scratched-up, oak table that had seen years of happy family dinners.' Using good descriptive detail makes for lively writing, which means writing that comes alive as if it was real, right there before you. </p><p>Adjectives, or good description written with adjectives, most often comes from the <b>senses</b>: what we see, hear, smell, taste, and feel. We see the color green; we hear jazzy, upbeat music; we smell sweet perfume; we taste spicy food; we feel chilly or sweaty; or we touch a couch that is fuzzy, rough, or smooth. Sometimes adjectives also describe a condition or state of being such as, 'I feel sick' or 'she looks sad' or 'happy childhood.' </p><h2 id="section---MoreExamples">More Examples</h2><p>How would we answer our friends, relatives, and co-workers the following questions if there were no adjectives? </p><ul>  <li>How do you like my new outfit? </li>  <li>How was the party? </li>  <li>How was the movie? </li>  <li>What's your new apartment like? </li>  <li>How are you feeling now? </li>  <li>How's your job? </li>  <li>How was the wedding? </li>  <li>What was Paris like? </li>  <li>How's the weather? </li>  <li>How are the driving conditions? </li>  <li>How's school going? </li> </ul><p>We couldn't answer any of these questions without adjectives, or describing words! Most of us, at some time or another, have laughed our heads off playing the game where you fill in the blanks of a story with different parts of speech. <b>Parts of speech</b> are exactly what they sound like - the different kinds of words we combine and use to say things in writing or speech, the parts of our speech. Nouns, verbs, and adjectives are all parts of speech. Remember that a <b>noun</b> is a person, place, or thing. A <b>verb</b> is an action. </p><h2 id="section---HowAdjectivesImproveSentences">How Adjectives Improve Sentences</h2><p>Imagine a fill-in-the-blank game without any descriptive words, as seen in this example: </p> 		</div> 		 		<p>A dog went for a walk with his friend the cat. They went down the street, through the park, to the beach, and onto the dock, where they smelled fish. They could see the water, feel the wind, and smell the food cooking in the restaurants. </p><p>Now, let's add adjectives to modify or describe the nouns: </p><p>A fluffy dog went for a long walk with his best friend the Siamese cat. They went down the main street, through the town park, to the sandy beach, and onto the old dock, where they smelled rotten fish. They could see the blue water, feel the cold wind, and smell the greasy food cooking in the boardwalk restaurants. </p><p>Using adjectives makes your writing more descriptive. When you use words that help the reader see, hear, smell, feel, or even imagine that he or she can taste what you're writing about your writing becomes more vivid or alive. If you bring a reader inside your scene with descriptive writing, he or she will be more compelled to keep reading because they're having what feels like a live experience. </p><h2 id="section---LessonSummary">Lesson Summary</h2><p>An <b>adjective</b> is a part of speech that describes a <b>noun</b>, which is another part of speech. <b>Parts of speech</b> are the different words we use to express ourselves in writing or speech. If we had no adjectives in our language to describe what we hear, see, smell, taste, and touch; to describe what condition we're in; or to paint a vivid scene as we write or speak, it would truly be a colorless world, as colors themselves are adjectives! </p><h2 id="section---LearningOutcomes">Learning Outcomes</h2><p>Progress through this lesson on adjectives so that you can accurately: </p><ul>  <li>Review sentences in which an adjective describes a noun </li>  <li>Understand the role of an adjective in providing details </li>  <li>Recognize examples of questions whose answers require the use of adjectives </li>  <li>Compare a paragraph that doesn't use adjectives to one that does</li> </ul></div>

    """<h2>What is a <span class="mw_t_parahw">noun</span>?</h2> <p><em>Nouns</em> make up the largest class of words in most languages, including English. A noun is a word that refers to a thing (<em>book</em>), a person (<em>Betty Crocker</em>), an animal (<em>cat</em>), a place (<em>Omaha</em>), a quality (<em>softness</em>), an idea (<em>justice</em>), or an action (<em>yodeling</em>). It's usually a single word, but not always: <em>cake</em>, <em>shoes</em>, <em>school bus</em>, and <em>time and a half</em> are all nouns. <p>There are a number of different categories of nouns. <p>There are <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/common%20noun"><em>common nouns</em></a> and <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/proper%20noun"><em>proper nouns</em></a>. A common noun refers to a person, place, or thing but is not the name of a particular person, place, or thing. Examples are <em>animal</em>, <em>sunlight</em>, and <em>happiness</em>. A proper noun is the name of a particular person, place, or thing; it usually begins with a capital letter: <em>Abraham Lincoln</em>, <em>Argentina</em>, and <em>World War I</em> are all proper nouns. <p>A <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/collective%20noun"><em>collective noun</em></a> is a noun that names a group of people or things, such as <em>flock</em> or <em>squad</em>. It's sometimes unclear whether the verb for a collective noun should be singular or plural. In the United States, such nouns as <em>company</em>, <em>team</em>, <em>herd</em>, <em>public</em>, and <em>class</em>, as well as the names of companies, teams, etc., are treated as singular, but in the United Kingdom they are often treated as plural: (<em>US</em>) "The team has been doing well this season." vs. (<em>British</em>) "The team have been doing well this season." <p><a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/gerund"><em>Gerunds</em></a> are nouns that are identical to the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/present%20participle"><em>present participle</em></a> (<em>-ing</em> form) of a verb, as in "I enjoy <em>swimming</em> more than <em>running.</em>" <p>An <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/attributive"><em>attributive</em></a> <em>noun</em> is a noun that modifies another noun that immediately follows it, such as <em>business</em> in <em>business meeting</em>. These <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/words-at-play/nouns-that-look-like-adjectives">nouns look like adjectives but they're not</a>. <p>For learners of English, the most important feature of a noun is whether it can be counted. A <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/count%20noun"><em>count noun</em></a> is a noun that can be used after <em>a</em> or <em>an</em> or after a number (or another word that means "more than one"). Count nouns have both singular and plural forms and can be used with both singular and plural verb forms, as with the word <em>letter</em> in "A <em>letter</em> for you is on the table. <em>Letters</em> for you arrive regularly." Sometimes the plural form of a count noun is the same as its singular form, as in "I saw a <em>deer</em> in my yard yesterday. There are a lot of <em>deer</em> in the woods near my house." <p>A <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mass%2Bnoun"><em>mass noun</em></a> (or <em>noncount noun</em>) refers to something that cannot be counted. Mass nouns are normally not used after the words <em>a</em> or <em>an</em> or after a number. They have only one form and are used with singular verb forms, as in "<em>Portuguese</em> is one of the languages they speak," and "The <em>information</em> was unclear." <p>Some nouns are not count or mass nouns. Nouns which only ever refer to one thing are called <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/singular"><em>singular</em></a> <em>nouns</em>: "<em>Saturn</em> is the sixth planet from the sun," "We heard a terrible <em>din</em> in the alley." And a <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/plural"><em>plural</em></a> <em>noun</em> refers to more than one person or thing, or sometimes to something that has two main parts. Plural nouns have only one form and are used with plural verb forms: "<em>Townspeople</em> are invited to a forum on the project," "These <em>scissors</em> are dull." <p>A particular noun can have any or all of these kinds of uses. <blockquote><p>(<em>count</em>) I've read that book several <em>times.</em> <p>(<em>mass</em>) <em>Time</em> seemed to stop when I saw him for the first time. <p>(<em>singular</em>) The <em>time</em> is 3:22. <p>(<em>plural</em>) Fuel costs three <em>times</em> as much as it did five years ago.</blockquote></div> <script>window.mwHeapEvents['Definition - Has Little Gem']="true";</script> <div id="examples-anchor" class="widget example_sentences examples-module-anchor"><h2>Examples of <em>noun</em> in a Sentence</h2> <script>window.mwHeapEvents['Definition - Has Henhouse']="true";</script> <div class="on-web"><span class="ex-header function-label">Recent Examples on the Web</span> <span class="ex-sent sents" data-example-id="7410870"><span class="t has-aq">The overenthusiastic guest lecturer who constructs a lengthy and banal presentation out of a series of random <em>nouns</em>.</span> <span class="aq has-aq">         	&mdash;""",
    """<h2 id="section---BackgroundOnCommunication">Background on Communication</h2><p>Spoken and written communication is like one big game of telephone. Sometimes we hear the original tale, and other times we hear a retelling of the story. In this lesson, we're going to explore what that means by studying the difference between direct and indirect speech and learning proper grammar techniques for both. </p><h2 id="section---DirectSpeech">Direct Speech</h2><p><b>Direct speech</b>, also known as quoted speech, consists of words or phrases that are taken directly from the source. These words are quoted or written exactly as the words were originally spoken. </p><p>With regards to direct speech, there is no interpretation or annotation; the words are taken directly from one source and repeated to another. In other words, we take the words directly from the speaker and repeat them exactly as they were originally stated. </p><p>Here are some examples of direct speech: </p><ul>  <li>Jonah said, ''I don't like your hat.'' </li>  <li>Jonah said, ''Please take off that Yankees hat.'' </li>  <li>Jane said, ''It's not my fault that you are a Red Sox fan.'' </li> </ul><p>In these examples, the direct speech is shown in quotations, which signifies that the speech is taken directly from the source with no alterations. </p><h2 id="section---IndirectSpeech">Indirect Speech</h2><p><b>Indirect speech</b>, also known as reported speech, is when words or phrases are reported in our own words. The original words are modified and/or interpreted as opposed to being quoted. </p><p>When talking about indirect speech, we use words that refer to something that has already happened. To do so, we are speaking in the past tense and are summarizing, modifying, or synthesizing what has already been said. </p><p>Here are some examples of indirect speech: </p><ul>  <li>Amy said it was cold. </li>  <li>He said he had been on Facebook since 2010. </li>  <li>She said she had been teaching college classes for two years. </li> </ul><h2 id="section---ConvertingDirectToIndirectSpeech">Converting Direct to Indirect Speech</h2><p>When we use direct speech, we are repeating what was said. When we use indirect speech, we're reporting what was said. Let's now look at some specific examples to learn how to change speech from direct to indirect. These examples will also reinforce the difference between direct and indirect speech. </p><p>1. Changing From Present Tense to Past Tense </p><p>When converting speech from direct to indirect, you must change the present tense verbs to the past tense and remove any quotation marks or commas. </p><p></p><table class="wikitable" border="1">  <tbody>   <tr class="odd">    <th>Direct Speech (Present Tense)</th>    <th>Indirect Speech (Past Tense)</th>   </tr>    <tr>    <td>Jenn says, ''I love watching TV.''</td>    <td>Jenn said she loved watching TV.</td>   </tr>   </tbody> </table><p>2. Changing From Simple Past Tense to Past Perfect Tense </p><p>What if the direct speech is already written in the past tense? If the sentence is written in simple past tense, you just remove the punctuation and change the verb to past perfect to make it indirect speech. </p><p></p><table class="wikitable" border="1">  <tbody>   <tr class="odd">    <th>Direct Speech (Simple Past Tense)</th>    <th>Indirect Speech (Past Perfect Tense)</th>   </tr>    <tr>    <td>Lana said, ''I saw him at the mall.''</td>    <td>Lana said she had seen him at the mall.</td>   </tr>   </tbody> </table><p>3. Changing Speech in the Form of a Question </p><p>What if direct speech is in the form of a question? For example: ''Do you want to go on a trip to Europe?'' To make a direct question indirect, follow the same tense change rules as before, add ''asked me'' to signify reporting a question, and keep the question word. </p><p></p> 		</div> 		tbody>   <tr class="odd">    <th>Direct Speech</th>    <th>Indirect Speech</th>   </tr>    <tr>    <td>''Do you want to go on a trip to Europe?''</td>    <td>She asked me if I wanted to go on a trip to Europe.</td>   </tr>   </tbody> </table><p>Do you see the changes? The sentence was changed to past tense, and the word ''want'' was changed to wanted to signify what was asked in the original question. Let's try one more example. </p><p></p><table class="wikitable" border="1">  <tbody>   <tr class="odd">    <th>Direct Speech</th>    <th>Indirect Speech</th>   </tr>    <tr>    <td>Lisa asked, ''What did you eat for lunch?''</td>    <td>Lisa asked me what I ate for lunch.</td>   </tr>   </tbody> </table><p>To change this question to indirect speech, we changed the verb to past tense and kept the question word. </p><p>4. Direct and Indirect Reported Requests </p><p>We have talked about reported statements and questions, but what if someone has a request? For example: ''Please don't click your pen during the exam.'' To change this direct request to indirect speech, we use the phrase ''asked me'' and then fill in the request. </p><p></p><table class="wikitable" border="1">  <tbody>   <tr class="odd">    <th>Direct Speech</th>    <th>Indirect Speech</th>   </tr>    <tr>    <td>''Please don't click your pen during the exam.''</td>    <td>He asked me not to click my pen during the exam.</td>   </tr>   </tbody> </table><p>Here's another example: </p><p></p><table class="wikitable" border="1">  <tbody>   <tr class="odd">    <th>Direct Speech</th>    <th>Indirect Speech</th>   </tr>    <tr>    <td>''Johnny, go to the store and get milk.''</td>    <td>She told Johnny to go to the store and get milk.</td>   </tr>   </tbody> </table><p>In this case, we used the phrase ''told Johnny to'' and completed filling in the original request. </p><h2 id="section---LessonSummary">Lesson Summary</h2><p>Whether you are repeating or reporting what someone has said, there are grammatical rules for both. First, ask yourself if you are repeating what someone has said, which is considered <b>direct speech</b>, or if you are reporting what someone has said, which is <b>indirect speech</b>. When converting from direct to indirect speech, you must change the tense and remove quotation marks. For example: </p><ul>  <li>When converting speech from direct to indirect, you must change the present tense verbs to the past tense. </li>  <li>If the direct speech is written in simple past tense, you just remove the punctuation and change the verb to past perfect to make it indirect speech. </li>  <li>To make a direct question indirect, follow the same tense change rules as before, add ''asked me'' to signify reporting a question, and keep the question word. </li>  <li>To change a direct request to indirect speech, use the phrase ''asked me'' and then fill in the request.</li> </ul></div>""",
    """<h2>What is a preposition?</h2> <p class="lead"><strong>A preposition is a word used to link </strong><a href="http://www.gingersoftware.com/content/grammar-rules/nouns/"><strong>nouns</strong></a><strong>, </strong><a href="http://www.gingersoftware.com/content/grammar-rules/pronouns-2/"><strong>pronouns</strong></a><strong>, or phrases to other words within a sentence. </strong>They act to connect the people, objects, time and locations of a sentence. <strong> Prepositions are usually short words, and they are normally placed directly in front of nouns. In some cases, you’ll find prepositions in front of </strong><a href="http://www.gingersoftware.com/content/grammar-rules/verbs/gerunds-and-infinitives/"><strong>gerund verbs</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p> <p>A nice way to think about prepositions is as the words that help glue a sentence together. They do this by expressing position and movement, possession, time and how an action is completed.</p> <p>Indeed, several of the most frequently used words in all of English, such as <em>of, to, for, with, on</em> and at, are prepositions. Explaining prepositions can seem complicated, but they are a common part of language and most of us use them naturally without even thinking about it.</p> <p>In fact, it’s interesting to note that prepositions are regarded as a ‘closed class’ of words in the English language. This means, unlike verbs and nouns, no new words are added to this group over time. In a way, it reflects their role as the functional workhorse of the sentence. They are unassuming and subtle, yet vitally important to the meaning of language.</p><p>There are two very important rules to remember when using prepositions. Because they are somewhat vague, learning about prepositions and using them correctly in sentences takes practice. Because 1:1 translation is often impossible when dealing with prepositions, even the most advanced English students have some difficulty at first.</p> <ul> <li>The first rule is that to make sentences clear, specific prepositions are needed. For example, the preposition <em>in</em> means one thing and the preposition <em>on</em> cannot substitute for it in all cases. Some prepositions are interchangeable but not always. The correct preposition means one particular thing and using a different proposition will give the sentence a very different meaning. <em>I want to see you <strong>in</strong> the house now, Bill!</em> means something very different from <em>I want to see you <strong>on</strong> the house now, Bill!</em> <strong><em>In</em></strong><em> the house</em> means Bill should go through the door, walk inside, and stand in the hall or living room. <strong><em>On</em></strong><em> the house</em> means Bill would need to get a ladder and climb to the roof where he would be <em>on top of</em> the house.</li> <li>The second rule for using prepositions is that prepositions are generally followed by nouns or pronouns. There was a time in the past when teachers held strictly to this rule, but it made for some clunky sentences. <em>I am seeking someone I can depend on</em> ends with the preposition <em>on</em>, so people who insisted that sentences shouldn’t end with a preposition would be forced to use convoluted and unnatural phrasing. To avoid ending that sentence above with a preposition, you’d have to say, <em>someone I can depend on is whom I am seeking.</em></li> <li>There are more than 100 prepositions in the English language. In addition, there are endless possibilities for creating  <a href="http://www.gingersoftware.com/content/grammar-rules/preposition/prepositional-phrases/"><strong>prepositional phrases</strong></a><strong><u>,</u></strong> phrases that begin with a preposition and end with a noun or pronoun.  In the following sections, you will find examples of prepositions, types of prepositions, a comprehensive list of prepositions, and some helpful preposition exercises. As you read the examples and study the list, remember that prepositions usually convey concepts such as comparison, direction, place, purpose, source possession, and time.</li> </ul> <h2>Examples of Prepositions</h2> <p>In the following sentences, examples of prepositions have been italicized. As you read, consider how using different prepositions or even different types of prepositions in place of the examples might change the relationship between the rest of the words in the sentence.</p> <ul> <li>I prefer to read <em>in </em>the library.</li> <li>He climbed <em>up</em> the ladder to get <em>onto</em> the roof.</li> <li>Please sign your name <em>on</em> the dotted line <em>after</em> you read the contract.</li> <li>Go <em>down</em> the stairs and <em>through</em> the door.</li> <li>He swam <em>across</em> the pool.</li> <li>Take your brother <em>with </em>you.</li> </ul> <h2>Types of Prepositions</h2> <p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; line-height: 16.5pt;"><span lang="EN-GB">There are three types of prepositions, including time prepositions, place prepositions, and direction prepositions.<br /> </span><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="http://www.gingersoftware.com/content/grammar-rules/preposition/preposition-time/" target="_blank"><b><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #3fa5b3;">Time prepositions</span></b></a></span><span lang="EN-GB" style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #525252;"> are those such as <i>before, after, during,</i> and <i>until; </i></span><span lang="EN-GB"><a href="http://www.gingersoftware.com/content/grammar-rules/preposition/preposition-place/" target="_blank"><b><span style="font-size: 10.5pt; font-family: 'Arial',sans-serif; color: #3fa5b3;">place prepositions</span></b></a></span><span lang="EN-GB"> are those indicating position, such as <i>around, between, </i>and <i>against; </i>and direction prepositions are those indicative of direction, such as <i>across, up, </i>and <i>down.</i> Each type of preposition is important.</span></p> <h2>Type of Prepositions</h2> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Prepositions of Time<br /> </strong></span>Basic examples of time prepositions include: <em>at, on, in, before</em> and <em>after</em>. They are used to help indicate when something happened, happens or will happen.

However, there is a set of guidelines that can help decide which preposition to use:</p> <p>For years, months, seasons, centuries and times of day, use the preposition <strong><em>in</em></strong>:</p> <ul> <li>I first met John <strong>in </strong>1987.</li> <li>It’s always cold <strong>in </strong>January</li> <li>Easter falls <strong>in</strong> spring each year.</li> <li>The Second World War occurred <strong>in </strong>the 20th century.</li> <li>We eat breakfast <strong>in</strong> the morning.</li> </ul> <p>For days, dates and specific holiday days, use the preposition <strong><em>on</em></strong>.</p> <ol> <li>We go to school <strong>on</strong> Mondays, but not <strong>on </strong>Sunday</li> <li>Christmas is <strong>on </strong>December 25<sup>th</sup>.</li> <li>Buy me a present <strong>on</strong> my birthday.</li> </ol> <p>For times, indicators of exception and festivals, use the preposition <strong><em>at</em></strong>:</p> <ul> <li>Families often argue <strong>at </strong>Christmas time.</li> <li>I work faster <strong>at </strong>night.</li> <li>Her shift finished <strong>at </strong>7pm.</li> </ul> <p><strong><em>Before</em></strong> and <strong><em>after</em></strong> should be much easier to understand than the other examples of prepositions of time. Both are used to explain when something happened, happens or will happen, but specifically in relation to another thing.</p> <ul> <li><strong>Before </strong>I discovered this bar, I used to go straight home <strong>after </strong>work.</li> <li>We will not leave <strong>before </strong>3pm.</li> <li>David comes <strong>before</strong> Bryan in the line, but <strong>after </strong>Louise.</li> </ul> <p>Other prepositions of time could include: <em>During, about, around, until and throughout. </em></p> <ul> <li>The concert will be staged <strong>throughout </strong>the month of May.</li> <li>I learned how to ski <strong>during </strong>the holidays.</li> <li>He usually arrives <strong>around </strong>3pm.</li> <li>It was <strong>about</strong> six in the morning when we made it to bed.</li> <li>The store is open <strong>until</strong> midnight.</li> </ul> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Prepositions of Place<br /> </strong></span></p> <p>To confuse matters a bit, the most common prepositions to indicate time – <strong>on, at, in </strong>– are also the most common prepositions to indicate position. However, the rules are a little clearer as place prepositions are a more rigid concept than time prepositions.</p> <p>Prepositions of place examples in the following sentences are in bold for easy identification.</p> <ul> <li>The cat is <strong>on </strong>the table.</li> <li>The dogs are <strong>in</strong> the kennel.</li> <li>We can meet <strong>at </strong>the crossroads.</li> </ul> <p>The guidelines can be broken down as follows:</p> <p><strong>On</strong> is used when referring to something with a surface:</p> <ul> <li>The sculpture hangs <strong>on </strong>the wall.</li> <li>The images are <strong>on </strong>the page.</li> <li>The specials are <strong>on</strong> the menu, which is <strong>on</strong> the table.</li> </ul> <p><strong>In</strong> is used when referring to something that is inside or within confined boundaries. This could be anything, even a country:</p> <ol> <li>Jim is <strong>in </strong>France, visiting his aunt <strong>in</strong> the hospital.</li> <li>The whiskey is <strong>in</strong> the jar <strong>in</strong> the fridge.</li> <li>The girls play <strong>in</strong> the garden.</li> </ol> <p><strong>At</strong> is used when referring to something at a specific point:</p> <ol> <li>The boys are <strong>at</strong> the entrance <strong>at</strong> the movie theater.</li> <li>He stood <strong>at </strong>the bus stop <strong>at</strong> the corner of Water and High streets.</li> <li>We will meet <strong>at</strong> the airport.</li> </ol> <p>Lot’s of other prepositions of place, such as <em>under, over, inside, outside, above </em>and<em> below</em> are used in English. There is, however, a lot less confusion as they refer to rigid positions rather than abstract ones.</p> <ul> <li>The cat is <strong>under</strong> the table.</li> <li>Put the sandwich <strong>over </strong>there.</li> <li>The key is locked <strong>inside</strong> the car.</li> <li>They stepped <strong>outside</strong> the house.</li> <li>Major is ranked <strong>above </strong>corporal.</li> <li>He is waving at you from <strong>below </strong>the stairs.</li> </ul> <p><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>Prepositions of Movement</strong></span></p> <p>Prepositions of movement are quite easy to understand as they are less abstract than prepositions of place and time. Essentially, they describe how something or someone moves from one place to another. The most commonly used preposition of movement is <strong><em>to</em></strong>, which usually serves to highlight that there is movement towards a specific destination.</p> <p>Prepositions of movement examples in the following sentences are in bold for easy identification.</p> <ul> <li>He has gone on vacation <strong>to </strong>France.</li> <li>She went <strong>to</strong> the bowling alley every Friday last summer.</li> <li>I will go <strong>to</strong> bed when I am tired.</li> <li>They will go <strong>to </strong>the zoo if they finish their errands.</li> </ul> <p>Other more specific prepositions of movement include: <em>through, across, off, down</em> and <em>into</em>. These prepositions can sometimes get mixed up with others. While they are similar, they have individual meanings that add context to the movement.</p> <p><strong><em>Across</em></strong> refers to moving from one side to another.</p> <ul> <li>Mike travelled <strong>across</strong> America on his motorcycle.</li> <li>Rebecca and Judi are swimming <strong>across</strong> the lake.</li> </ul> <p><strong><em>Through</em></strong> refers to moving directly inside something and out the other end.</p> <ul> <li>The bullet Ben shot went <strong>through </strong>the window.</li> <li>The train passes <strong>through</strong> the tunnel.</li> </ul> <p><strong><em>Into</em></strong> refers to entering or looking inside something.</p> <ul> <li>James went<strong> into </strong>the room<strong>. </strong></li> <li>They stare <strong>into</strong> the darkness.</li> </ul> <p><strong><em>Up, over, down, past</em></strong> and <strong><em>around</em> </strong>indicate directions of movement:</p> <ol> <li>Jack went <strong>up</strong> the hill.</li> <li>Jill came tumbling <strong>down </strong>after.</li> <li>We will travel <strong>over</strong> rough terrain on our way to Grandma’s house.</li> <li>The horse runs <strong>around</strong> the track all morning.</li> <li>A car zoomed <strong>past</strong> a truck on the highway</li> </ol> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>How to Recognize a Preposition?</strong></p> <p>Recognizing prepositions can be challenging as they do not always follow a consistent pattern in terms of their position in a sentence, nor do they have a discernible structure or spelling. We do know, however, that prepositions are almost always short words, with the majority having less than six letters. One technique people use to identify a preposition is to think of a preposition as <strong><em>anywhere a mouse can go</em></strong>. <em>Above, below, next to, between, beyond, through, by, with</em>…It won’t cover them all, but it can be a useful question to ask when trying to identify and recognize a preposition. While there are over 100 prepositions, there are around 500,00-700,000 nouns in English! It is unlikely anyone will learn so many nouns, but recognizing and then mastering prepositions might be a worthwhile and attainable goal.</p> <p><strong>Prepositions with Nouns</strong></p> <p>There are lots of different nouns that carry specific prepositions to consolidate their meaning. These are called dependent prepositions. Again, there isn’t a set rule that says a particular type of noun will take a dependent preposition, although they normally follow the noun. Moreover, there are many possible combinations. Essentially, it’s case of familiarizing yourself with the different possibilities of nouns and dependent prepositions. Examples:</p> <ul> <li>He displayed <strong>cruelty</strong> <strong>towards</strong> his dog.</li> <li>She had <strong>knowledge</strong> <strong>of </strong>physics.</li> <li>The <strong>trouble</strong> <strong>with </strong>Jack.</li> <li>21 is the <strong>age at</strong> which you are allowed to drink.</li> <li>Bolt made another <strong>attempt at</strong> the world record.</li> <li>The police held an <strong>inquiry into</strong> the murder.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Prepositions with Verbs</strong></p> <p>Prepositional verbs – the phrasal combinations of verbs and prepositions – are important parts of speech. The prepositions again act as links between the verb and noun or gerund, giving extra meaning to the sentence. The prepositions most commonly used with verbs are: <em>to, for, about, of, in, at</em> and <em>from</em>. The good news is that these will always come after the verb in the sentence. However, it should also be noted that the prepositional verbs can have slightly different meaning compared to the original verb. For example, <em>to relate a story</em> simply means to tell a story, to relate <strong>to</strong> a story means you identify with it, find some personally meaning in that story.</p> <p>Verb + to:</p> <ul> <li>He <strong>admitted to </strong>the charge.</li> <li>I <strong>go to</strong> Vancouver on vacation twice a year.</li> <li>William can <strong>relate to</strong> the character in the play.</li> </ul> <p>Verb + for:</p> <ul> <li>He must <strong>apologize for</strong> his actions.</li> <li>We <strong>searched for</strong> ages before we found the perfect apartment.</li> <li>I <strong>provide for</strong> my family by working two jobs.</li> </ul> <p>Verb + with:</p> <ul> <li>I don’t <strong>agree with</strong> your claim.</li> <li>The lawyer said he will <strong>meet with</strong> your representatives.</li> <li>They <strong>began with</strong> a quick warm-up.</li> </ul> <p>Verb + of:</p> <ul> <li>I <strong>dream of</strong> a better life.</li> <li>Have you <strong>heard of</strong> Shakespeare?</li> <li>The bread <strong>consists of</strong> dough, raisins and a little honey.</li> </ul> <p>Verb + in:</p> <ul> <li>Does Rick <strong>believe in</strong> miracles?</li> <li>Fallon <strong>lives in</strong> New York.</li> <li>The bus accident <strong>resulted in</strong> my being late to work.</li> </ul> <p>Verb + at</p> <ol> <li>We <strong>arrived at</strong> our destination.</li> <li>Ilene <strong>excels at </strong>singing.</li> <li>Will the baby <strong>smile at </strong>her mother?</li> </ol> <p>Verb + on:</p> <ul> <li>We should really<strong> concentrate on</strong> our studies now.</li> <li>Helen <strong>insisted on</strong> Brenda’s company.</li> <li>Morris <strong>experimented on</strong> some canvas.</li> </ul> <p>Verb + from:</p> <ul> <li>Since turning 80, she <strong>suffers from</strong> lapses in concentration.</li> <li>Dad <strong>retired from</strong> the navy in the 1970s.</li> <li>Billy Bob, please <strong>refrain from</strong> doing that.</li> </ul> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p><strong>Prepositions with Adjectives </strong></p> <p>Prepositions can form phrases with adjectives to give further context to the action, emotion or thing the adjective is describing. Like verbs and nouns, adjectives can be followed by: <strong><em>to, about, In, for, with, at</em></strong> and <strong>by</strong>.</p> <ul> <li>I am happily <strong>married to </strong>David.</li> <li>Ellie is <strong>crazy about</strong> this movie.</li> <li>Michelle is <strong>interested in </strong>politics.</li> <li>We are <strong>sorry for</strong> your loss.</li> <li>Jane will be <strong>delighted with</strong> her results.</li> <li>Is he still <strong>angry at</strong> the world?</li> <li>The entire room was <strong>astonished by</strong> the election results.</li> </ul> <p>There can sometimes be a pattern in deciding which prepositions go with adjectives, for example, when adjectives have the same or very similar meaning to each other, they might take the same preposition:</p> <ul> <li>Frightened <strong>of</strong>, afraid <strong>of</strong>, scared <strong>of</strong>, terrified <strong>of</strong></li> </ul> <p>Indeed, when adjectives have opposite meaning they might also take the same preposition:</p> <ul> <li>Good <strong>at</strong>, great <strong>at</strong>, superb <strong>at</strong>, wonderful <strong>at</strong></li> <li>Bad <strong>at</strong>, terrible <strong>at</strong>, woeful<strong> at</strong>, inept <strong>at</strong></li> </ul> <p>There are always many exceptions to the above, but it can help that there seems to be some</p> <p>consistency when adjectives have the same meaning or opposite meaning.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Nevertheless, perhaps a more general rule is that English speakers simply need to learn which prepositions go with which adjectives, as meaning can change significantly by using a different preposition.</p> <ul> <li><em>I am <strong>good at</strong> sports</em> means I have some athletic talent.</li> <li><em>The nurse was <strong>good to</strong> my mother </em>means she took care of her and was nice, kind, and helpful.</li> <li><em>I am <strong>good with</strong> animals</em> means I get along with them and handle them well.</li> <li><em>Swimming is <strong>good for</strong> your health.</em></li> <li><em>That was <strong>good of</strong> you to come</em> means you were begin nice and good to visit.</li> <li><em>My little brother is <strong>good inside </strong>(his body) </em>means even though you can’t see how he thinks and feels, he is good. Even if his behavior is bad.</li> <li><em>The blueberry jam will be <strong>good on </strong>toast. </em></li> </ul> <h2>Prepositions Exercises</h2> <p>The following exercises will help you gain greater understanding about how prepositions work.

It contrasts with the <b>active voice</b>, where the subject is the agent of action. Passive voice sentences are not incorrect, but people often avoid them because they're not as easy to understand. Passive voice sentences can occur in both past and future tense. </p><p>Here are some examples: </p><p><i>That pizza was eaten by Sam.</i> <i>Sam</i>, the subject, comes after the verb <i>eaten</i>. This creates a passive voice. </p><p><i>Sam ate that pizza.</i> <i>Sam</i>, the subject, is <b>before</b> the verb. This creates the active voice. </p><h2 id="section---PassiveVoicePastAndFutureTense">Passive Voice: Past and Future Tense</h2><p>Passive voice sentences like <i>That pizza was eaten by Sam</i> are in the <b>past tense</b>. The past tense passive voice always includes a form of the verb 'to be' (<i>am, are, is, were, was, being, been,</i> and <i>be</i>) and a <i>past participle</i> of the main verb. A <i>participle</i> is a word formed from a verb. For example in this sentence, <i> eaten</i> (past participle) is formed from <i>eat.</i> </p><p>The <b>future tense</b> passive voice also has the <i>be</i> verb, but these sentences include the modal verb <i>will</i> and the past participle. A <i>modal</i> is a word that expresses possibility. </p><p><i>I will write the article.</i> Active voice (subject is before the verb) </p><p><i>The article will be written by me</i>. Passive voice (subject is after the verb) </p><h2 id="section---LessCommonTypesOfPassiveVoiceSentences">Less Common Types of Passive Voice Sentences</h2><p>Some passive voice sentences are awkward and less common. </p><p>For example, <i>Writing is something he does.</i> In this passive voice sentence, <i>writing</i> is the action. But the agent of action is <i>he</i>, so <i>he</i> is the subject. <i>Writing</i> appears to be the subject but isn't. The subject follows the verb in this sentence, so it's in the passive voice. If you reconstructed this sentence in the active voice, you might just say, <i>He writes</i>. </p><p>Another less common type of passive voice sentence occurs when the agent of action is ambiguous or unknown, as in these two examples: </p><p><i>His house was robbed yesterday.</i> (by someone unknown) </p><p><i>The new stadium will be built on the north side of town.</i> (by some yet-unnamed company) </p><p>In these sentences, the verb comes before the subject, since the unknown subject is implied. </p> 		</div><p>In academic and scientific writing, the passive voice is used to achieve a more objective and scientific 'tone.' For example, <i>All structures were suggested.</i> In this case, the subject is unnamed, but is implied to be perhaps a group of researchers or a single scientist. </p><h2 id="section---HowDoIGetRidOfThePassiveVoice">How Do I Get Rid of the Passive Voice?</h2><p>After reading over your work, you might find that the passive voice is too prevalent in your work, or you might think it weakens the effect of your arguments. No worries - you can correct them following these general guidelines: </p><p>1. Identify the verb. </p><p>2. Identify the subject (either stated or implied). </p><p>3. Begin a new sentence, making sure the subject is at the beginning of the sentence before the verb and is the 'agent of action,' the person, place or thing that's doing the action. </p><h2 id="section---LearningOutcomes">Learning Outcomes</h2><p>Once you've completed this lesson, you'll be able to: </p><ul>  <li>Distinguish between active and passive voice </li>  <li>Differentiate between past tense and future tense passive voice </li>  <li>Explain how to change passive voice into active voice</li> </ul></div>

    """<h2 id="section---WhatIsTheActiveVoice">What Is the Active Voice?</h2><p>We've all heard this before from our English teachers: 'You should always write in the <b>active voice</b>.' But what exactly does this mean? Here are two different ways to construct a similar sentence. </p><p>1. Henry threw the ball. </p><p>2. The ball was thrown by Henry. </p><p>Let's take a look at the first sentence. The <b>subject</b> of the sentence is 'Henry,' and 'ball' is the <b>object</b>, which receives the action of the <b>verb</b> 'threw'. </p><p>Now moving onto the second sentence, we can see that 'ball' is the subject of the sentence, and 'Henry' is now the object that receives the action of the verb 'was thrown'. </p><p>The grammatical term <b>active voice</b> refers to a sentence in which the subject performs an action indicated by the verb. The first sentence is written in active voice, because Henry is the subject and he is performing the action. </p><p>By comparison, the second sentence is written in <b><span class="textLessonLink"><a class="external" href="https://study.com/academy/lesson/what-are-active-and-passive-voice-in-writing.html">passive voice</a></span></b>, because Henry is no longer the subject; now, he's just the object at the end of the sentence. In grammar, the passive voice refers to sentences in which the verb acts upon a noun or subject, which receives instead of initiates the action. </p><h2 id="section---Examples">Examples</h2><p>Here are some more examples of sentences using the active voice: </p><ul>  <li>I called Jimmy last night. </li>  <li>Deborah read the book. </li>  <li>Bobby dug the ditch. </li> </ul><p>Now, let's take a look at how those same sentences read in the passive voice: </p><ul>  <li>Jimmy was called by me last night. </li>  <li>The book was read by Deborah. </li>  <li>The ditch was dug by Bobby. </li> </ul><p>Did you notice that all the sentences written in the passive voice used the verb 'to be'? </p><h2 id="section---ImportanceOfTheActiveVoice">Importance of the Active Voice</h2><p>Creative writing and especially business reports need to be direct and to the point. As a writer, you don't want your audience and readers to lose interest. Writing in the active voice not only helps to maintain their interest; it can also dramatically improve the quality of your work. In following one of the most basic grammar and writing principles, you want to make sure you know who is doing what in a sentence. Sentences written in the active voice have life and energy in them. They are also cleaner and less wordy. Sentences written in the passive voice often sound awkward, almost backwards and convoluted. </p><p>Go back and take a look at some of the examples of sentences written in the active and passive voice shown earlier in the lesson and read them out loud. Notice how more energetic and engaging the active voice sentences are compared to the examples written in passive voice. </p><p>Remember, it's one thing to grab your reader's attention; it's another thing to maintain the reader's focus. Writing complicated, dull, and wordy sentences in the passive voice can bore or even confuse your reading audience. </p><h2 id="section---IdentifyingTheActiveVoice">Identifying the Active Voice</h2><p>When you're done with this lesson, go find a copy of a paper that you've written in the past. Read through it to see if there are any instances where you may have written in the passive voice. They're usually accompanied by two warning signs: </p><ul>  <li>While not always true, often times the word 'by' indicates the passive voice, as in, 'an action was done <i>by</i> someone!' Whenever you spot the word 'by' in your writing, go back and double-check your sentence. </li>  <li>A form of the verb 'to be' typically indicates the use of the passive voice, as in 'some action was being done by someone!' Be on the lookout for all of the verb's tenses: 'am,' 'are,' 'is,' 'was,' 'were,' 'been,' and 'being.' </li> </ul> 		</div><p>If you've read over one of your papers and noticed that you have a few passive voice issues, don't worry! They're an easy fix. In order to change from passive voice to active voice, you need to establish the subject of the sentence and then rewrite it so the subject is doing the action. Essentially, you'll need to place the subject before the object and the action </p><p>Let's try revising this passive sentence: </p><ul>  <li>The donuts were eaten by Ron. </li> </ul><p>First, did you spot the two passive voice indicators: 'were eaten', which uses a form of the verb 'to be', and 'by?' Next, find the subject of the sentence by asking yourself, 'who is doing the action?' In this sentence, Ron is the subject. So, all we need to do now is rewrite the sentence so the subject comes before the action and the object and change the verb accordingly. Let's change the verb to 'ate.' </p><p><i>Ron ate the donuts.</i> </p><p>That's it! Now the reader can clearly understand who is doing what. </p><h2 id="section---PassiveVoiceIsnTAlwaysBad">Passive Voice Isn't Always Bad</h2><p>While the passive voice gets a bad rap, it's important to understand that writing in the passive voice is not grammatically incorrect. In fact, like everything in life, sentences in the passive voice have their place. This is especially true when you want to emphasize the object more than the subject of a sentence. For instance, imagine you're writing an article advocating lowering the speed limit, which includes these two sentences: </p><p>'After several road fatalities, we now see that the legislation is outdated and dangerous. The old law was written by the committee a hundred years ago.' </p><p>While the second sentence is written in the passive voice, it's the best way to emphasize the old law, not the committee. That's because we're using the article to try and change the law. </p><h2 id="section---LessonSummary">Lesson Summary</h2><p>In grammar, our verbs can speak in one of two ways: the active voice or the passive voice. </p><p>When we use the <b>active voice</b> in a sentence, we let our subject perform an action indicated by the verb. </p><p>By comparison, the <b>passive voice</b> refers to sentences in which the verb acts upon the noun or subject, which receives instead of initiates the action. </p><p>Although it's not grammatically incorrect to write in the passive voice, doing so can make your writing sound awkward and confusing. A well-written essay or paper strives to be energetic and alive and keep the reader turning the page. One way to achieve this goal is by using the active voice. </p><h2 id="section---LearningOutcomes">Learning Outcomes</h2><p>After finishing the video, you should be able to: </p><ul>  <li>Explain what active voice means </li>  <li>Differentiate between active and passive voice </li>  <li>Describe reasons for using active voice </li>  <li>Identify examples of active voice</li> </ul></div>""",
    """<h2 id="typ" class="purpleStyle">Types of Sentences</h2> <p>There are four main types of sentences:</p> <ol> <li><strong><a title="Declarative Sentences" href="http://plato.algonquincollege.com/applications/guideToGrammar/?page_id=3243#dec">Simple or Declarative Sentence</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a title="Imperative Sentences" href="http://plato.algonquincollege.com/applications/guideToGrammar/?page_id=3243#imp">Command or Imperative Sentence</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a title="Interrogative Sentences" href="http://plato.algonquincollege.com/applications/guideToGrammar/?page_id=3243#int">Question or Interrogative Sentence</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a title="Exclamatory Sentences" href="http://plato.algonquincollege.com/applications/guideToGrammar/?page_id=3243#exc">Exclamatory Sentence</a></strong></li> </ol><h2 id="dec" class="purpleStyle">Declarative Sentences</h2> <p>These sentences are used to state information. They are the most commonly used sentence type. Most academic writing employs simple or declarative sentences. Declarative sentences end with a period. For example:</p> <ul> <li>Research on the topic suggests that grammar is essential to success.</li> </ul><h2 id="imp" class="purpleStyle">Imperative Sentences</h2> <p>These sentences give commands or make requests. Imperative sentences end with a period. For example:</p> <ul> <li>Open the window.</li> </ul><h2 id="int" class="purpleStyle">Interrogative Sentences</h2> <p>These sentences ask questions. Accordingly, they end with a question mark. For example:</p> <ul> <li>Did you complete the assignment?</li> </ul><h2 id="exc" class="purpleStyle">Exclamatory Sentences</h2> <p>These sentences express emotion and, as such, end with an exclamation mark.</p> <ul> <li>She is going to fall!</li> </ul> <p>Exclamatory sentences are not common in academic writing. You should only use them if you have to convey a strong emotion, which does not happen often in academic writing as it tends to be objective and formal.</p><h2 id="add" class="purpleStyle">Additional Hints on Variety</h2> <p>Once you are comfortable with the different types and constructions of sentences, try to incorporate more variety into your writing.</p> <p>A question can be especially useful at the beginning of a paragraph where you want to summarize what preceded and then launch into what will now follow. “And what were the results of the Quebec Act of 1774?” This reminds your readers where you are in your discussion — <em>Ah yes, that’s what we’re talking about</em> — and prepares them for what comes next.</p> <p>A command or directive provides direction and energy. Readers react to being grabbed by the collar and told what to do. A command is hard to ignore. Tone is important here. A bit of well-intentioned cajoling is usually more useful than in-your-face shouting. “Learning the principle of parallel structure can be the most important thing you learn in writing class. Learn it now!”</p> <p>Try beginning an occasional sentence with something other than the normal subject-followed-by-verb order of things. Begin with a modifying clause or participial phrase instead. “When sterilization of the equipment is complete, the dental hygienist can begin to focus on his or her client.” “Having sterilized the equipment, the dental hygienist started focusing on his client.”</p> <p>Try to vary your sentence structure between simple, compound, and complex constructions to keep the reader interested. It does no good to be overly conscious of these sentence types in the first draft of your essay, but as you review your essay, keep in mind that too many sentences of any one kind — especially too many simple sentences — will be tedious for your reader. Variety of sentence structure and type liberates your text from monotony. <strong>

<p>An <b>article</b> is a word used to modify a noun, which is a person, place, object, or idea. Technically, an article is an <b>adjective</b>, which is any word that modifies a noun. Usually adjectives modify nouns through description, but articles are used instead to point out or refer to nouns. There are two different types of articles that we use in writing and conversation to point out or refer to a noun or group of nouns: definite and indefinite articles. </p><h2 id="section---DefiniteArticle">Definite Article</h2><p>Let's begin by looking at the <b>definite article</b>. This article is the word 'the,' and it refers directly to a specific noun or groups of nouns. For example: </p><ul>  <li>the freckles on my face </li>  <li>the alligator in the pond </li>  <li>the breakfast burrito on my plate </li> </ul><p>Each noun or group of nouns being referred to - in these cases freckles, alligator, and breakfast burrito - is direct and specific. </p><h2 id="section---IndefiniteArticles">Indefinite Articles</h2><p><b>Indefinite articles</b> are the words 'a' and 'an.' Each of these articles is used to refer to a noun, but the noun being referred to is not a specific person, place, object, or idea. It can be any noun from a group of nouns. For example: </p><ul>  <li>a Mercedes from the car lot </li>  <li>an event in history </li> </ul><p>In each case, the noun is not specific. The Mercedes could be any Mercedes car available for purchase, and the event could be any event in the history of the world. </p><h2 id="section---ArticleUsageWithExamples">Article Usage with Examples</h2><p>Properly using a definite article is fairly straightforward, but it can be tricky when you are trying to figure out which indefinite article to use. The article choice depends on the sound at the beginning of the noun that is being modified. There is a quick and easy way to remember this. </p><p>If the noun that comes after the article begins with a vowel sound, the appropriate indefinite article to use is 'an.' A <b>vowel sound</b> is a sound that is created by any vowel in the English language: 'a,' 'e,' 'i,' 'o,' 'u,' and sometimes 'y' if it makes an 'e' or 'i' sound. For example: </p><ul>  <li>an advertisement on the radio (this noun begins with 'a,' which is a vowel) </li>  <li>an element on the periodic table (this noun begins with 'e,' which is also a vowel) </li> </ul><p>If the noun that comes after the article begins with a consonant sound, the appropriate indefinite article to use is 'a.' A <b>consonant sound</b> is a sound that comes from the letters that are not the vowels in the English language. For example: </p><ul>  <li>a tire on my car (the noun the article modifies begins with 't,' which is a consonant) </li>  <li>a baboon at the zoo (the noun the article modifies begins with 'b,' which is also a consonant) </li><p>Sometimes a noun begins with a consonant, but when you say the word out loud, it makes a vowel sound. For example, the word 'hour' begins with an 'h,' but when you say it out loud, it may sound like it begins with an 'o.' In this case, you would pay attention to the sound that it makes, rather than just looking at the letter. If it is a vowel sound, use the article 'an' instead of 'a.' For example: </p><ul>  <li>an hour </li>  <li>an hors d'oeuvre </li> </ul><p>On the other hand, sometimes a noun begins with a vowel, but when you say the word out loud, it makes a consonant sound. For example, the word 'union' begins with a 'u,' which is a vowel, but when you say the word out loud, it sounds like it begins with a 'y,' which is a consonant. Again in this case, pay attention to the sound rather than the letter. For example: </p><ul>  <li>a unicorn from a fairytale </li>  <li>a ukulele in a music store </li> </ul><h2 id="section---LessonSummary">Lesson Summary</h2><p>An <b>article</b> is a word used to modify a noun. In other words, we use articles to point out or refer to nouns in conversation and writing. If you are referring to a specific noun, use the definite article 'the'. If you are referring to a noun that could be any member of a group of nouns, use one of the indefinite articles 'a' or 'an'. To choose the appropriate indefinite article, pay attention to the sound that the noun begins with. If the noun begins with a vowel sound, use the article 'an.' If the noun begins with a consonant sound, use the article 'a.' Keep in mind that the letter and the sound don't always match up, so watch your words, and be careful to choose the appropriate article. </p>""",
    """<h2 id="section---RepetitiveActionVerbs">Repetitive Action Verbs</h2><p>Think about your daily schedule. What time do you wake up, eat breakfast, or do homework? These actions are repetitive. You do them every day. Any time you develop something of a routine, you have to use simple present tense verbs to describe it. </p><p>Take a look at simple present tense verbs, what they look like, and when to use them. </p><h2 id="section---WhatIsTheSimplePresentTense">What Is the Simple Present Tense?</h2><p>The <b>simple present tense</b> is when you use a verb to tell about things that happen continually in the present, like every day, every week, or every month. We use the simple present tense for anything that happens often or is factual. Here are a few examples: </p><ul>  <li>I go to school every day. </li>  <li>We play outside after school each day. </li>  <li>Every Monday they eat spaghetti for dinner. </li> </ul><p>In these sentences, ''go,'' ''play,'' and ''eat'' are in the simple present tense. They tell about things that happen repeatedly in the present. The simple present tense is also used with basic facts and with feelings. </p><p>For example: </p><ul>  <li>The sky is blue. </li> </ul><p>''Is'' is in the simple present tense, since it's used to tell a fact about something. </p><ul>  <li>I am tired. </li>  <li>They are so excited. </li> </ul><p>''Am'' and ''are'' are in the simple present tense and describe emotions. </p><p>Just remember, when you're using a simple present tense verb, you're describing something that continues to repeat itself in the present. </p><h2 id="section---WhatItLooksLike">What It Looks Like</h2><p>Use simple present tense verbs in the base form of the verb. Do not add any kind of suffix, like ''-ed'' or ''-ing.'' Just like the previous example sentences, the base forms of ''go,'' ''play,'' and ''eat'' were used. </p><p>However, you do change the simple present verb when the subject describes ''he,'' ''she,'' or ''it'' - do this by adding an ''-s.'' Look at these examples: </p><ul>  <li>Carlos plays with his sister on Saturday mornings. </li>  <li>She talks on the phone often. </li> </ul><p>''Plays'' and ''talks'' are simple present verbs that need an ''-s,'' since the subjects are a version of ''he'' or ''she.'' Exceptions to this rule are when a verb ends in ''s,'' ''x,'' ''sh,'' or ''ch.'' In these cases, we need to add ''-es,'' just like in these sentences: </p><ul>  <li>He watches his favorite show whenever it's on. </li>  <li>Jackie faxes the information whenever they need it. </li> </ul><p>''Watches'' and ''faxes'' are simple present verbs that need, ''-es'' when they are paired with a subject that is a ''he'' or ''she.'' ''Watches'' ends in ''ch,'' while ''faxes'' ends in an ''x.'' </p><p>Another exception is when a verb ends in ''y.'' In this case, drop the ''y'' and add ''-ies.'' Note: This is true except when the ''y'' follows a vowel. Here are a few more examples: </p><ul>  <li>She tries her best on every test. </li>  <li>Every day, the principal says the pledge of allegiance over the intercom. </li> </ul><p>''Try'' ends in a ''y,'' so change it to ''-ies'' when it is paired with the subject ''she'' in the simple present tense. However, ''say'' ends with an ''ay'' (a vowel before the ''y''), so it only needs an ''-s.'' </p><h2 id="section---WhatItIsNot">What It Is Not</h2><p>The simple present tense is not the same as the present participle tense, which uses ''-ing'' and describes what is happening in that moment. For example: </p><ul>  <li>I'm finishing my homework. </li>  <li>We're watching a movie. </li> </ul><p>These verbs, ''finishing'' and ''watching'' are not in the simple present tense. They tell what is happening in that moment, not what is happening repeatedly in the present. </p><h2 id="section---LessonSummary">Lesson Summary</h2><p>When an action is a routine, something that happens repeatedly in the present, use <b>simple present tense</b> verbs. You would use a simple present tense verb to describe a tradition that happens repeatedly. You could say: </p><ul>  <li>Every year we eat candy on Halloween. </li> </ul><p>''Eat'' is a simple present tense verb; it describes a yearly tradition and it's in its base form. </p><p>Remember that simple present verbs are in the base form and only need suffixes when the subject is third-person singular. For example: </p><ul>  <li>He plays piano every Friday. </li> </ul><p>In this sentence, ''plays'' is in the simple present tense.</p><h2>Present Perfect Continuous Forms</h2> <p>The present perfect continuous is formed using <strong><em>has/have + been</em> + present participle</strong>.

Be careful because this can change the meaning of the sentence. Future continuous emphasizes interrupted actions, whereas future perfect continuous emphasizes a duration of time before something in the future. Study the examples below to understand the difference. </p> <div class="ex">     <p>Examples:</p>     <ul>       <li>He will be tired because he <strong>will be exercising</strong> so hard.<br>         <em class="comment">This sentence emphasizes that he will be tired because he will be exercising at that exact moment in the future. </em></li>       <li>He will be tired because he <strong>will have been exercising</strong> so hard.<br>         <em class="comment">This sentence emphasizes that he will be tired because he will have been exercising for a period of time. It is possible that he will still be exercising at that moment OR that he will just have finished.</em><br>         </li>       </ul> </div> <h3>REMEMBER No Future in Time Clauses</h3> <p>Like all future forms, the future perfect continuous cannot be used in clauses beginning with time expressions such as: when, while, before, after, by the time, as soon as, if, unless, etc. Instead of future perfect continuous, <a href="presentperfectcontinuous.html">present perfect continuous</a> is used. </p> <div class="ex">     <p>Examples:</p>     <ul> 	  <li>You won't get a promotion until you <strong>will have been working</strong> here as long as Tim. <em class="incorrect">Not Correct</em></li>       <li>You won't get a promotion until you <strong>have been working</strong> here as long as Tim. <em class="correct">Correct</em></li>     </ul> </div><h3>AND REMEMBER Non-Continuous Verbs / Mixed Verbs</h3> <p>It is important to remember that <a href="types.html">non-continuous verbs</a> cannot be used in any continuous tenses. Also, certain non-continuous meanings for <a href="types.html">mixed verbs</a> cannot be used in continuous tenses.     Instead of using   Future perfect continuous with these verbs, you must use <a href="futureperfect.html">future perfect </a>.</p> <div class="ex">     <p>Examples:</p>     <ul>       <li>Ned <strong>will </strong><strong>have been having </strong> his driver's license for over two years. <em class="incorrect">Not Correct</em></li>       <li>Ned <strong>will </strong><strong>have had </strong> his driver's license for over two years. <em class="correct">Correct</em></li>       </ul> </div> <h3>ADVERB PLACEMENT</h3> <p>The examples below show the placement for grammar adverbs such as: always, only, never, ever, still, just, etc.</p> <div class="ex">     <p>Examples:</p>     <ul>       <li>You will <strong>only</strong> have been waiting for a few minutes when her plane arrives.</li>       <li>Will you <strong>only</strong> have been waiting for a few minutes when her plane arrives?</li>       </ul>     <ul>       <li>You are <strong>only</strong> going to have been waiting for a few minutes when her plane arrives.</li>       <li>Are you <strong>only</strong> going to have been waiting for a few minutes when her plane arrives?</li>       </ul> </div> <h3>ACTIVE / PASSIVE</h3> <div class="ex">     <p>Examples:</p>     <ul>       <li>The famous artist <strong>will have been painting</strong> the mural for over six months by the time it is finished. <em class="comment">Active</em></li>       <li>The mural <strong>will have been being painted</strong> by the famous artist for over six months by the time it is finished. <em class="comment">Passive</em></li>       </ul> 	  <ul>       <li>The famous artist <strong>is going to have been painting</strong> the mural for over six months by the time it is finished. <em class="comment">Active</em></li>       <li>The mural <strong>is going to have been being painted</strong> by the famous artist for over six months by the time it is finished. <em class="comment">Passive</em></li>       </ul> </div>""",
